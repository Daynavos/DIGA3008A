        Setting up GitHub was quite a straight-forward process. I found it interesting to see how simple it is to publish a web page. 
        It demystified the process and the task of creating websites which I am grateful for. I read “As we may think at 65.” I also read about the dot-com bubble 
        and Web 2.0. These three readings complement each other well. The first take away, for me, is the personal aspect that is brought up in both “Think 65” and 
        “Web 2.0”. Bush was interested in having the access of information mimic the human brain. He wanted a dynamic thought process as opposed to a hierarchical 
        structure of alphabetized lists. I do believe Hypermedia is the closest we have come to replicating the human process of jumping from one thought to another. 
        The personal aspect, however, is what interests me more. Web 2.0 is centered around this idea - that the web is an interactive and personal experience. 
        This has many benefits but a sad truth is that a lot of this personalisation is geared towards profits. Personalised ads being a key example, although it 
        does not seem to stop there. The first main concern is the creatin of ecosystems within the web where people only see what they want to see and are told what 
        they already believe. This could lead to harmful views thriving. The second concern is the capitalist overtone. The dot-com bubble being a prime example. 
        A large majority of the web consists of companies that are publicly trading. This means that their profits are dependant on their growth and therefor they 
        are forced to get attention. More users and more time form those users. This need from the companies lead to tactics that encourage addiction and unsafe practices. 
        The web has become an overwhelming place and although the beauty of what Bush proposed years ago is achieved it seems to be overshadowed by the need to wade 
        through all the noise. This constant growth that is desired by tech companies seems unsustainable. If the turn of the century dot-com bubble was any indication, 
        it is not outrageous to say that it is. The first thing I find interesting about the history of the web is the fact that the people who seemed to conceptualize 
        it did not see it as an electrical system and rather a mechanical one. I also believe that the creation of the smart phone was a large catalyst for Web 2.0 and 
        I learned that Blackberry was the company to revolutionise this by figuring out how to connect a phone to the internet using data. The lead engineer for this 
        was Mike Lazaridis.
        My goal for this course is to learn as much as I possibly can. I want to take advantage of the opportunity to make a portfolio website that I can be proud of. 
        I would like for the website to be a clear representation of who I am and what I can produce. The hope being for the portfolio to lead to employment 
        opportunities. I plan to develop artistically and challenge myself technically in this course.

        Reading
        The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the political, social and cultural implications of this new form of media.
        With each of McLuhan’s four laws Moulthrop makes it clear that the “revolution” is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and not truly fuelled by intellectual engagement. This however seems to be the case with all media the world has ever encountered. Where there is media, there will be propaganda. Where there is information, it will be manipulated and withheld. Hypertext is not immune to this and the influence of this seems to be greater since more and more information can be consumed faster and faster, meaning that misinformation and propaganda is all around.
        What does Hypertext enhance? The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new form of media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closer simulate a human thought process. Nonlinear information retrieval and intertextuality skyrocketed. This is constantly improving and can be seen in things like the Wikirace.
        The next law and question is, what does hypertext render obsolete? He states that hypertext has not rendered other media obsolete but that we have seen a great shift in how people choose to engage with information. Many books have been converted to a hypertext format where it is easy to jump form one chapter of topic to another. Hypertext has enhanced physical media and has slowly started replacing it. Environmental concerns and convenience being big driving factors in today’s time.
        What does hypertext retrieve? Moulthrop states that hypertext is more interactive than books but less than TV. He claims that hypertext has almost fetched old literacy and brought it into the interactive era.
        Lastly, we ask, what happens when hypertext reaches its limit? McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed to its extreme, it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea to hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open, participatory network, it has increasingly been controlled by corporate and institutional interests.

        What does interaction mean to you?
        Interaction for the purposes of this course has been defined as the ability to meaningfully change the state of something. This definition suits me well. I do, however, personally feel that this definition is geared towards excluding books and film. I see the value of this since the nature of that media is very linear and static. I believe that these forms of media can be included with an asterisk. Since the way in which you choose to interact with the piece of media can change its influence on you even if it is not truly changing the media itself. I do, nonetheless, think it is prudent to exclude these “static medias” from our definition.
