      Setting up GitHub was quite a straight-forward process. I found it
      interesting to see how simple it is to publish a web page. It demystified
      the process and the task of creating websites which I am grateful for. I
      read “As we may think at 65.” I also read about the dot-com bubble and Web
      2.0. These three readings complement each other well. The first take away,
      for me, is the personal aspect that is brought up in both “Think 65” and
      “Web 2.0”. Bush was interested in having the access of information mimic
      the human brain. He wanted a dynamic thought process as opposed to a
      hierarchical structure of alphabetized lists. I do believe Hypermedia is
      the closest we have come to replicating the human process of jumping from
      one thought to another. The personal aspect, however, is what interests me
      more. Web 2.0 is centered around this idea - that the web is an
      interactive and personal experience. This has many benefits but a sad
      truth is that a lot of this personalisation is geared towards profits.
      Personalised ads being a key example, although it does not seem to stop
      there. The first main concern is the creatin of ecosystems within the web
      where people only see what they want to see and are told what they already
      believe. This could lead to harmful views thriving. The second concern is
      the capitalist overtone. The dot-com bubble being a prime example. A large
      majority of the web consists of companies that are publicly trading. This
      means that their profits are dependant on their growth and therefor they
      are forced to get attention. More users and more time form those users.
      This need from the companies lead to tactics that encourage addiction and
      unsafe practices. The web has become an overwhelming place and although
      the beauty of what Bush proposed years ago is achieved it seems to be
      overshadowed by the need to wade through all the noise. This constant
      growth that is desired by tech companies seems unsustainable. If the turn
      of the century dot-com bubble was any indication, it is not outrageous to
      say that it is. The first thing I find interesting about the history of
      the web is the fact that the people who seemed to conceptualize it did not
      see it as an electrical system and rather a mechanical one. I also believe
      that the creation of the smart phone was a large catalyst for Web 2.0 and
      I learned that Blackberry was the company to revolutionise this by
      figuring out how to connect a phone to the internet using data. The lead
      engineer for this was Mike Lazaridis. My goal for this course is to learn
      as much as I possibly can. I want to take advantage of the opportunity to
      make a portfolio website that I can be proud of. I would like for the
      website to be a clear representation of who I am and what I can produce.
      The hope being for the portfolio to lead to employment opportunities. I
      plan to develop artistically and challenge myself technically in this
      course.

      Reading The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to
      Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the
      political, social and cultural implications of this new form of media.
      With each of McLuhan’s four laws Moulthrop makes it clear that the
      “revolution” is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and not truly fuelled
      by intellectual engagement. This however seems to be the case with all
      media the world has ever encountered. Where there is media, there will be
      propaganda. Where there is information, it will be manipulated and
      withheld. Hypertext is not immune to this and the influence of this seems
      to be greater since more and more information can be consumed faster and
      faster, meaning that misinformation and propaganda is all around. What
      does Hypertext enhance? The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new
      form of media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big
      enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closer simulate a human thought
      process. Nonlinear information retrieval and intertextuality skyrocketed.
      This is constantly improving and can be seen in things like the Wikirace.
      The next law and question is, what does hypertext render obsolete? He
      states that hypertext has not rendered other media obsolete but that we
      have seen a great shift in how people choose to engage with information.
      Many books have been converted to a hypertext format where it is easy to
      jump form one chapter of topic to another. Hypertext has enhanced physical
      media and has slowly started replacing it. Environmental concerns and
      convenience being big driving factors in today’s time. What does hypertext
      retrieve? Moulthrop states that hypertext is more interactive than books
      but less than TV. He claims that hypertext has almost fetched old literacy
      and brought it into the interactive era. Lastly, we ask, what happens when
      hypertext reaches its limit? McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed
      to its extreme, it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea
      to hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open, participatory
      network, it has increasingly been controlled by corporate and
      institutional interests. Links

      What does interaction mean to you? Interaction for the purposes of this
      course has been defined as the ability to meaningfully change the state of
      something. This definition suits me well. I do, however, personally feel
      that this definition is geared towards excluding books and film. I see the
      value of this since the nature of that media is very linear and static. I
      believe that these forms of media can be included with an asterisk. Since
      the way in which you choose to interact with the piece of media can change
      its influence on you even if it is not truly changing the media itself. I
      do, nonetheless, think it is prudent to exclude these “static medias” from
      our definition.

      User Alignment The primary goal of my portfolio website is to attract
      employment opportunities in technical fields such as Software Development,
      Game Design, or Web Development. My target audience consists of potential
      employers who are looking for candidates with strong technical skills and
      creative problem-solving abilities. To effectively engage these users, my
      portfolio must clearly communicate my expertise while offering a seamless
      and engaging browsing experience. Site Content Mapping To organize my
      portfolio effectively, I have structured the content into different
      skill-based categories: Software Birds (A project showcasing my software
      development skills) Game Design Games (A collection of games I have worked
      on) Itch (A link to my Itch.io profile for game projects) Personal
      Projects Music (Showcasing my personal creative projects outside of
      software and game development) Each section will highlight my skills and
      accomplishments in the respective domain, making it easy for employers to
      assess my capabilities quickly. User Experience Focus Employers often
      browse multiple portfolios when searching for candidates. To ensure my
      portfolio stands out, I aim to create an experience that is both visually
      appealing and functionally efficient. Key considerations include: Easy
      Navigation: Employers should be able to quickly locate relevant sections
      without unnecessary clicks. Performance Optimization: A fast-loading
      website ensures a smooth and frustration-free experience. Intuitive
      Design: The site should not only look good but also feel good to use,
      providing an enjoyable interaction for the user. Interface Elements The
      interface design consists of two primary aspects: Aesthetics: Inspired by
      the DIY, collage-style aesthetic of zines, my portfolio will have a
      creative and visually unique layout. Functionality: Navigation will be
      designed to be seamless, enabling users to explore content quickly while
      ensuring that my skills and projects are clearly showcased. The goal is to
      strike a balance between creativity and usability, making the site
      memorable while ensuring it remains professional and accessible.
      Development Progress Reflection This week, my focus has been on
      familiarizing myself with HTML and starting to build the foundational
      structure of the site. While the current version is still rough, progress
      is being made towards refining the layout and content organization. One
      area that needs more attention is the implementation of semantic HTML
      strategies. This will be a focus for the coming week as I work towards
      making the site more structured and accessible. By improving semantic
      markup, I aim to enhance both readability for search engines and usability
      for visitors.

    Post your work for the design section of your website, which you will submit
    next week. Wireframes image.pngimage.png image.pngimage.png Styles
    image.pngimage.pngimage.png I am drawing inspiration from classic zines. I
    want to convey the aesthetic of print and physical media in my website. Work
    through the IxD Process and begin noting your thoughts. You will continue
    adding to this as you progress. Reflect on how your original wireframes hold
    up in line with this process. My interaction Design so far has had a focus
    on navigation. I added things like jump links, and I hope to add similar
    elements like status bars etc. I find that the interaction experience of the
    website will evolve and with this evolution become more and more
    complicated. My main concern if to not loose the core of what I want my
    website to be as I add more elements to it. I want the website to
    communicate my skills in an easily accessible way that does not overwhelm or
    annoy a viewer/user. I feel little materialisation of my original wireframes
    and therefore believe that they still hold up quite well, although I believe
    they will be challenged more once more stylistic and structural elements
    starts to ne added to the website. I am fully expecting my wireframes to
    change and evolve. I am simply using them as a placeholder and to keep me
    from not developing blindly. I and under no Impression that they will be my
    final website. Reflect on your work for Website 1. Where have you struggled?
    What are you proud of? What do you want to change going forward? The
    creation of website 1 has been quite interesting thus far. I have not found
    the actual language implementation necessarily challenging but more so the
    act of deconstructing the design process into the different languages and
    building the website layer by layer as opposed to component piece by
    component piece. I find myself constantly fighting off the urge to add more
    depth and meat to the site and opposed to continually broadening the site. I
    find it difficult to not see my wireframes materialize in a structural and
    artistic way. The large disconnect between the design and implementation,
    largely with regards to structure, is a struggle I, and I believe many
    others, face. The Semantic markup is interesting and useful to me, but I
    find myself overthinking and overwhelmed by it. I always believe that I am
    adding too little or too much. I find this exhausting. This sentiment is
    extended significantly by micro formatting, where these exact feelings were
    even verbalised in the lecture videos. I am proud that I have, in my
    opinion, kept to good semantic practices and I have hardcoded any structure
    or formatting. I am proud of the general flow of my website. I believe that
    the navigation of my website is simple and intuitive. I donnot find the
    navigation to hinder the purposes of the website. This is one of my core
    interaction principles and therefore I am proud.
