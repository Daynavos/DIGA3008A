      Setting up GitHub was quite a straight-forward process. I found it
      interesting to see how simple it is to publish a web page. It demystified
      the process and the task of creating websites which I am grateful for. I
      read “As we may think at 65.” I also read about the dot-com bubble and Web
      2.0. These three readings complement each other well. The first take away,
      for me, is the personal aspect that is brought up in both “Think 65” and
      “Web 2.0”. Bush was interested in having the access of information mimic
      the human brain. He wanted a dynamic thought process as opposed to a
      hierarchical structure of alphabetized lists. I do believe Hypermedia is
      the closest we have come to replicating the human process of jumping from
      one thought to another. The personal aspect, however, is what interests me
      more. Web 2.0 is centered around this idea - that the web is an
      interactive and personal experience. This has many benefits but a sad
      truth is that a lot of this personalisation is geared towards profits.
      Personalised ads being a key example, although it does not seem to stop
      there. The first main concern is the creatin of ecosystems within the web
      where people only see what they want to see and are told what they already
      believe. This could lead to harmful views thriving. The second concern is
      the capitalist overtone. The dot-com bubble being a prime example. A large
      majority of the web consists of companies that are publicly trading. This
      means that their profits are dependant on their growth and therefor they
      are forced to get attention. More users and more time form those users.
      This need from the companies lead to tactics that encourage addiction and
      unsafe practices. The web has become an overwhelming place and although
      the beauty of what Bush proposed years ago is achieved it seems to be
      overshadowed by the need to wade through all the noise. This constant
      growth that is desired by tech companies seems unsustainable. If the turn
      of the century dot-com bubble was any indication, it is not outrageous to
      say that it is. The first thing I find interesting about the history of
      the web is the fact that the people who seemed to conceptualize it did not
      see it as an electrical system and rather a mechanical one. I also believe
      that the creation of the smart phone was a large catalyst for Web 2.0 and
      I learned that Blackberry was the company to revolutionise this by
      figuring out how to connect a phone to the internet using data. The lead
      engineer for this was Mike Lazaridis. My goal for this course is to learn
      as much as I possibly can. I want to take advantage of the opportunity to
      make a portfolio website that I can be proud of. I would like for the
      website to be a clear representation of who I am and what I can produce.
      The hope being for the portfolio to lead to employment opportunities. I
      plan to develop artistically and challenge myself technically in this
      course.

      Reading The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to
      Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the
      political, social and cultural implications of this new form of media.
      With each of McLuhan’s four laws Moulthrop makes it clear that the
      “revolution” is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and not truly fuelled
      by intellectual engagement. This however seems to be the case with all
      media the world has ever encountered. Where there is media, there will be
      propaganda. Where there is information, it will be manipulated and
      withheld. Hypertext is not immune to this and the influence of this seems
      to be greater since more and more information can be consumed faster and
      faster, meaning that misinformation and propaganda is all around. What
      does Hypertext enhance? The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new
      form of media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big
      enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closer simulate a human thought
      process. Nonlinear information retrieval and intertextuality skyrocketed.
      This is constantly improving and can be seen in things like the Wikirace.
      The next law and question is, what does hypertext render obsolete? He
      states that hypertext has not rendered other media obsolete but that we
      have seen a great shift in how people choose to engage with information.
      Many books have been converted to a hypertext format where it is easy to
      jump form one chapter of topic to another. Hypertext has enhanced physical
      media and has slowly started replacing it. Environmental concerns and
      convenience being big driving factors in today’s time. What does hypertext
      retrieve? Moulthrop states that hypertext is more interactive than books
      but less than TV. He claims that hypertext has almost fetched old literacy
      and brought it into the interactive era. Lastly, we ask, what happens when
      hypertext reaches its limit? McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed
      to its extreme, it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea
      to hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open, participatory
      network, it has increasingly been controlled by corporate and
      institutional interests. Links https://wordstone.com/team/

      interaction mean to you? Interaction for the purposes of this course has
      been defined as the ability to meaningfully change the state of something.
      This definition suits me well. I do, however, personally feel that this
      definition is geared towards excluding books and film. I see the value of
      this since the nature of that media is very linear and static. I believe
      that these forms of media can be included with an asterisk. Since the way
      in which you choose to interact with the piece of media can change its
      influence on you even if it is not truly changing the media itself. I do,
      nonetheless, think it is prudent to exclude these “static medias” from our
      definition.

      User Alignment

The primary goal of my portfolio website is to attract employment opportunities in technical fields such as Software Development, Game Design, or Web Development. My target audience consists of potential employers who are looking for candidates with strong technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities. To effectively engage these users, my portfolio must clearly communicate my expertise while offering a seamless and engaging browsing experience.

Site Content Mapping

To organize my portfolio effectively, I have structured the content into different skill-based categories:

Software
Birds (A project showcasing my software development skills)
Game Design
Games (A collection of games I have worked on)
Itch (A link to my Itch.io profile for game projects)
Personal Projects
Music (Showcasing my personal creative projects outside of software and game development)
Each section will highlight my skills and accomplishments in the respective domain, making it easy for employers to assess my capabilities quickly.

User Experience Focus

Employers often browse multiple portfolios when searching for candidates. To ensure my portfolio stands out, I aim to create an experience that is both visually appealing and functionally efficient. Key considerations include:

Easy Navigation: Employers should be able to quickly locate relevant sections without unnecessary clicks.
Performance Optimization: A fast-loading website ensures a smooth and frustration-free experience.
Intuitive Design: The site should not only look good but also feel good to use, providing an enjoyable interaction for the user.
Interface Elements

The interface design consists of two primary aspects:

Aesthetics: Inspired by the DIY, collage-style aesthetic of zines, my portfolio will have a creative and visually unique layout.
Functionality: Navigation will be designed to be seamless, enabling users to explore content quickly while ensuring that my skills and projects are clearly showcased.
The goal is to strike a balance between creativity and usability, making the site memorable while ensuring it remains professional and accessible.

Development Progress Reflection

This week, my focus has been on familiarizing myself with HTML and starting to build the foundational structure of the site. While the current version is still rough, progress is being made towards refining the layout and content organization.

One area that needs more attention is the implementation of semantic HTML strategies. This will be a focus for the coming week as I work towards making the site more structured and accessible. By improving semantic markup, I aim to enhance both readability for search engines and usability for visitors.
