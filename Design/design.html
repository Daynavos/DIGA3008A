            I look forward to seeing if these wireframes materialize with the

        <h3>Aesthetic Inspiration</h3>
        <p>
          Aesthetically I am drawing inspiration from "Zines". I want the
          website to have the essence of physical media. I am particularly
          interested in the style of collages and screen printing and would like
          my website to have that essence.
        </p>

          I would like almost every part of the website to be accessible from
          any other part of the website.

        <!-- Fonts and Colours Section -->
        <h3>Fonts and Colours</h3>
        <p>
          I want the structure and feel of the site to be quite grungy and harsh
          and therefore I am opting for a softer font.
        </p>

        <p>The following colours are under consideration:</p>
        <img

          alt="Colour palette: Aqua greens and blue grays"

            Iteration Three: JavaScript is Cool
            <span class="dropdown-icon">▾</span>
          </h2>
        </summary>

        <p>
          Each section of this design process seems to be increasingly more
          challenging than the previous, but as a result, way more rewarding and
          way cooler. (I know "cool" is a bit of a non-word, but I believe my
          point is made without the use of flowery language.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I found HTML very boring, CSS quite cool, and JavaScript absolutely
          awesome. I understand the reason for us being taught the three
          separate disciplines at separate times, but I would be lying if I said
          I would ever want to make a website like that again. I feel the
          completely separated workflow seems quite inefficient. I find myself
          doing and redoing things over and over again, somewhat paralyzed by
          all the possible ways to do that one thing. I found this very
          frustrating, and my main goal going forward is to focus on developing
          in a way that is modular and scalable.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/root.png" alt="Image of the root system in CSS" />
        <p>
          For example, I started using the :root system in CSS and plan to keep
          doing things like that. I believe JavaScript is perfect for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goals for this iteration were mostly to just get JavaScript in
          there, but also in a way that did not feel unnecessary. I personally
          find many animations and movement in a website annoying and even
          cumbersome. I therefore tried to do mostly functional JavaScript. I'm
          not sure how successful I was, but I am excited to polish it for my
          final iteration. A core focus will be to get back the physical media
          idea I originally had. I do feel that essence has mostly been lost.
          There are also a few things I opted to do with HTML and CSS and not
          JavaScript that I would like to implement with JavaScript —
          specifically injecting the footer, nav bar, and 'to top' button for
          each page.
        </p>
        <p>Here are some effects I want to add:</p>
        <img src="Images/cdcase.png" alt="Image of the CD case effect" />
        <p>
          I want to add a CD case effect to my music player on the home screen.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/gallery.png" alt="Image of the gallery wall" />
        <p>
          I want to add a gallery wall effect to my homepage game selection to
          add to the physical media feel.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/newColor.png" alt="Image of expanded color palette" />
        <p>I am thinking of expanding my color palette slightly.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to add a Personal page (I still might), but I do feel like I
          would rather polish and perfect what I have now before I add anything
          more than is needed. I also attempted to embed a 3D model, but it only
          worked in Live Server and I couldn't figure out why.
        </p>
        <img src="Images/model.png" alt="Image of 3D model in Live Server" />
        <p>
          Overall, the design for this website has been challenging, and to be
          honest, I feel like I only now have the flow of it down. I almost want
          to make a new style guide and wireframes that are maybe just slightly
          different, just because I understand better what needs to be taken
          into account now. I think being taught these design steps as separate
          steps is useful (especially for teaching purposes), but they are far
          more overlapped than we were taught, and I look forward to designing
          with a better grasp of the bigger picture.
