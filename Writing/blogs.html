              Setting up GitHub was a straightforward process. I found it
              fascinating to discover how simple it is to publish a web page.
              This demystified the process of creating websites, for which I am
              grateful. I read “As We May Think at 65,” along with articles
              about the dot-com bubble and Web 2.0. These three readings
              complement each other well. One key takeaway for me was the
              personal aspect explored in both “Think 65” and “Web 2.0.” Bush
              envisioned access to information mimicking the human brain, aiming
              for a dynamic thought process rather than the hierarchical
              structure of alphabetized lists. I believe Hypermedia is the
              closest we've come to replicating the human process of jumping
              from one thought to another. The personal aspect, however, is what
              intrigues me the most. Web 2.0 focuses on making the web an
              interactive and personal experience. While this has many benefits,
              a concerning truth is that much of this personalization is
              profit-driven. Personalized ads are a prime example, though the
              implications go far beyond this. Main Concerns:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Ecosystems of Conformity: Within the web, ecosystems are being
                created where people are shown only what they want to see and
                are reinforced in their beliefs. This could allow harmful views
                to thrive unchecked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Capitalist Overtones: The dot-com bubble illustrates how much of
                the web is driven by publicly traded companies. Their profits
                depend on continuous growth, which drives tactics aimed at
                capturing attention and increasing time spent online. Such
                practices can foster addiction and unsafe habits.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As a result, the web has become an overwhelming space. While
              Bush's vision of dynamic information retrieval has been achieved,
              it is often overshadowed by the noise created by profit-driven
              motives. This constant growth desired by tech companies seems
              unsustainable, and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century
              signals the risks of unchecked expansion.

              Reflection on Moulthrop's Hypertext and the Laws of Media
            </h4>
            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-24">
              24 February 2025

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to
              Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the
              political, social, and cultural implications of this new form of
              media. With each of McLuhan’s four laws, Moulthrop makes it clear
              that the "revolution" is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and
              not truly fueled by intellectual engagement. This, however, seems
              to be the case with all media the world has ever encountered.
              Where there is media, there will be propaganda. Where there is
              information, it will be manipulated and withheld. Hypertext is not
              immune to this, and the influence seems to be greater since more
              and more information can be consumed faster, leading to
              misinformation and propaganda all around What does hypertext
              enhance? The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new form of
              media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big
              enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closely simulate a
              human thought process. Nonlinear information retrieval and
              intertextuality skyrocketed. This is constantly improving and can
              be seen in activities like the Wikirace. What does hypertext
              render obsolete? Moulthrop states that hypertext has not rendered
              other media obsolete but has caused a significant shift in how
              people choose to engage with information. Many books have been
              converted to a hypertext format, where it is easy to jump from one
              chapter or topic to another. Hypertext has enhanced physical media
              and is slowly replacing it, with environmental concerns and
              convenience being big driving factors in today’s time. What does
              hypertext retrieve? Moulthrop states that hypertext is more
              interactive than books but less so than TV. He claims that
              hypertext has almost "fetched" old literacy and brought it into
              the interactive era. What happens when hypertext reaches its
              limit? McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed to its extreme,
              it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea to
              hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open,
              participatory network, it has increasingly been controlled by
              corporate and institutional interests. Links:

            <h5>What does interaction mean to you?</h5>

            Interaction, for the purposes of this course, has been defined as
            the ability to meaningfully change the state of something. This
            definition suits me well. I do, however, feel that this definition
            is geared towards excluding books and film. I see the value of this
            exclusion since the nature of these media is very linear and static.
            However, I believe that these forms of media can be included with an
            asterisk since the way in which you choose to interact with the
            media can change its influence on you, even if it does not truly
            change the media itself. Nonetheless, I think it is prudent to
            exclude these "static media" from our definition.

            <p>
              User Alignment: The primary goal of my portfolio website is to
              attract employment opportunities in technical fields such as
              Software Development, Game Design, or Web Development. My target
              audience consists of potential employers seeking candidates
              withtechnical skills and creative problem-solving abilities. To
              effectively engage these users, my portfolio must clearly
              communicate my expertise while providing a seamless and engaging
              browsing experience. Site Content Mapping: To organize my
              portfolio effectively, I have structured the content into
              different skill-based categories:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Software: Birds—a project showcasing my software development
                skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                Game Design:
                <ul>
                  <li>Games—a collection of games I have worked on.</li>
                  <li>Itch—a link to my Itch.io profile for game projects.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal Projects: Music—showcasing my personal creative
                projects outside of software and game development.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Each section will highlight my skills and accomplishments in the
            respective domain, making it easy for employers to quickly assess my
            capabilities. User Experience Focus: Employers often browse multiple
            portfolios when searching for candidates. To ensure my portfolio
            stands out, I aim to create an experience that is both visually
            appealing and functionally efficient. Key considerations include:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Easy Navigation: Employers should be able to locate relevant
                sections without unnecessary clicks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance Optimization: A fast-loading website ensures a
                smooth and frustration-free experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Intuitive Design: The site should not only look good but also
                feel good to use, providing an enjoyable interaction for the
                user.
              </li>
            </ol>

            Interface Elements: The interface design focuses on two primary
            aspects:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Aesthetics: Inspired by the DIY, collage-style aesthetic of
                zines, my portfolio will feature a creative and visually unique
                layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Functionality: Seamless navigation will enable users to explore
                content quickly while ensuring my skills and projects are
                clearly showcased.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The goal is to strike a balance between creativity and usability,
            making the site memorable while remaining professional and
            accessible. Development Progress Reflection: This week, my focus has
            been on familiarizing myself with HTML and starting to build the
            foundational structure of the site. While the current version is
            still rough, progress is being made towards refining the layout and
            content organization. One area needing more attention is the
            implementation of semantic HTML strategies. This will be my focus in
            the coming week as I work toward making the site more structured and
            accessible. By improving semantic markup, I aim to enhance both
            readability for search engines and usability for visitors.

            <p>
              Design Inspiration: I am drawing inspiration from classic zines,
              aiming to convey the aesthetic of print and physical media in my
              website. My focus is on incorporating this style while maintaining
              a functional and accessible design. Interaction Design Thoughts:
              My interaction design so far has prioritized navigation. I have
              added features like jump links and plan to integrate similar
              elements, such as status bars, to enhance usability. I anticipate
              that the interaction experience of the website will evolve,
              becoming more complex. My main concern is ensuring that I do not
              lose sight of my website's core purpose as I introduce additional
              elements. Ultimately, I want the site to communicate my skills in
              an accessible way that does not overwhelm or frustrate users.
              Wireframes Reflection: I feel my original wireframes have not been
              fully realized yet, which is why I believe they still hold up
              well. However, I expect they will be challenged as more stylistic
              and structural elements are added to the website. I see my
              wireframes as placeholders, serving to guide development and
              prevent me from working aimlessly. I hold no illusion that they
              represent the final iteration of my website. Instead, I fully
              expect them to evolve as the design progresses. Website 1
              Development Reflection: The creation of Website 1 has been an
              interesting journey. While I have not found the implementation of
              languages particularly challenging, breaking down the design
              process into distinct layers rather than building component by
              component has been an adjustment. I often struggle with resisting
              the urge to add depth and complexity to the site prematurely,
              rather than broadening and refining it gradually. This has made it
              difficult to see my wireframes materialize both structurally and
              artistically. The disconnect between design and implementation,
              especially regarding structure, is a challenge I face—and one I
              believe others encounter as well. Semantic Markup and
              Microformatting: I find semantic HTML both fascinating and
              overwhelming. I frequently worry whether I am adding too much or
              too little, which can be exhausting. This struggle extends to
              microformatting, where similar concerns were even mentioned in the
              lecture videos. Despite this, I am proud of adhering to good
              semantic practices and avoiding hardcoding when organizing the
              structure or formatting. Key Accomplishments:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                I am proud of the overall flow of my website, believing the
                navigation is simple, intuitive, and aligned with the website's
                purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                This focus on clear and accessible navigation is one of my core
                interaction principles, which I feel I have executed well.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Looking Ahead: My focus moving forward will be refining the layout,
            enhancing semantic markup, and continuing to align the design with
            the core principles of usability and accessibility.
