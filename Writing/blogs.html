          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              Setting up GitHub was a straightforward process. I found it
              fascinating to discover how simple it is to publish a web page.
              This demystified the process of creating websites, for which I am
              grateful. I read “As We May Think at 65,” along with articles
              about the dot-com bubble and Web 2.0. These three readings
              complement each other well. One key takeaway for me was the
              personal aspect explored in both “Think 65” and “Web 2.0.” Bush
              envisioned access to information mimicking the human brain, aiming
              for a dynamic thought process rather than the hierarchical
              structure of alphabetized lists. I believe Hypermedia is the
              closest we've come to replicating the human process of jumping
              from one thought to another. The personal aspect, however, is what
              intrigues me the most. Web 2.0 focuses on making the web an
              interactive and personal experience. While this has many benefits,
              a concerning truth is that much of this personalization is
              profit-driven. Personalized ads are a prime example, though the
              implications go far beyond this. Main Concerns:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Ecosystems of Conformity: Within the web, ecosystems are being
                created where people are shown only what they want to see and
                are reinforced in their beliefs. This could allow harmful views
                to thrive unchecked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Capitalist Overtones: The dot-com bubble illustrates how much of
                the web is driven by publicly traded companies. Their profits
                depend on continuous growth, which drives tactics aimed at
                capturing attention and increasing time spent online. Such
                practices can foster addiction and unsafe habits.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As a result, the web has become an overwhelming space. While
              Bush's vision of dynamic information retrieval has been achieved,
              it is often overshadowed by the noise created by profit-driven
              motives. This constant growth desired by tech companies seems
              unsustainable, and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century
              signals the risks of unchecked expansion.

              A reflection on Moulthrop's "Hypertext and the Laws of Media".
            </h4>
            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-24">
              24 February 2025
            </time>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to
              Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the
              political, social, and cultural implications of this new form of
              media. With each of McLuhan’s four laws, Moulthrop makes it clear
              that the "revolution" is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and
              not truly fueled by intellectual engagement. This, however, seems
              to be the case with all media the world has ever encountered.
              Where there is media, there will be propaganda. Where there is
              information, it will be manipulated and withheld. Hypertext is not
              immune to this, and the influence seems to be greater since more
              and more information can be consumed faster, leading to
              misinformation and propaganda all around What does hypertext
              enhance? The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new form of
              media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big
              enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closely simulate a
              human thought process. Nonlinear information retrieval and
              intertextuality skyrocketed. This is constantly improving and can
              be seen in activities like the Wikirace. What does hypertext
              render obsolete? Moulthrop states that hypertext has not rendered
              other media obsolete but has caused a significant shift in how
              people choose to engage with information. Many books have been
              converted to a hypertext format, where it is easy to jump from one
              chapter or topic to another. Hypertext has enhanced physical media
              and is slowly replacing it, with environmental concerns and
              convenience being big driving factors in today’s time. What does
              hypertext retrieve? Moulthrop states that hypertext is more
              interactive than books but less so than TV. He claims that
              hypertext has almost "fetched" old literacy and brought it into
              the interactive era. What happens when hypertext reaches its
              limit? McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed to its extreme,
              it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea to
              hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open,
              participatory network, it has increasingly been controlled by
              corporate and institutional interests. Links:

            <h5>What does interaction mean to you?</h5>
            <p>
              Interaction, for the purposes of this course, has been defined as
              the ability to meaningfully change the state of something. This
              definition suits me well. I do, however, feel that this definition
              is geared towards excluding books and film. I see the value of
              this exclusion since the nature of these media is very linear and
              static. However, I believe that these forms of media can be
              included with an asterisk since the way in which you choose to
              interact with the media can change its influence on you, even if
              it does not truly change the media itself. Nonetheless, I think it
              is prudent to exclude these "static media" from our definition.

              User Alignment: The primary goal of my portfolio website is to
              attract employment opportunities in technical fields such as
              Software Development, Game Design, or Web Development. My target
              audience consists of potential employers seeking candidates
              withtechnical skills and creative problem-solving abilities. To
              effectively engage these users, my portfolio must clearly
              communicate my expertise while providing a seamless and engaging
              browsing experience. Site Content Mapping: To organize my
              portfolio effectively, I have structured the content into
              different skill-based categories:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Software: Birds—a project showcasing my software development
                skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                Game Design:
                <ul>
                  <li>Games—a collection of games I have worked on.</li>
                  <li>Itch—a link to my Itch.io profile for game projects.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal Projects: Music—showcasing my personal creative
                projects outside of software and game development.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each section will highlight my skills and accomplishments in the
              respective domain, making it easy for employers to quickly assess
              my capabilities. User Experience Focus: Employers often browse
              multiple portfolios when searching for candidates. To ensure my
              portfolio stands out, I aim to create an experience that is both
              visually appealing and functionally efficient. Key considerations
              include:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Easy Navigation: Employers should be able to locate relevant
                sections without unnecessary clicks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance Optimization: A fast-loading website ensures a
                smooth and frustration-free experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Intuitive Design: The site should not only look good but also
                feel good to use, providing an enjoyable interaction for the
                user.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Interface Elements: The interface design focuses on two primary
              aspects:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Aesthetics: Inspired by the DIY, collage-style aesthetic of
                zines, my portfolio will feature a creative and visually unique
                layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Functionality: Seamless navigation will enable users to explore
                content quickly while ensuring my skills and projects are
                clearly showcased.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The goal is to strike a balance between creativity and usability,
              making the site memorable while remaining professional and
              accessible. Development Progress Reflection: This week, my focus
              has been on familiarizing myself with HTML and starting to build
              the foundational structure of the site. While the current version
              is still rough, progress is being made towards refining the layout
              and content organization. One area needing more attention is the
              implementation of semantic HTML strategies. This will be my focus
              in the coming week as I work toward making the site more
              structured and accessible. By improving semantic markup, I aim to
              enhance both readability for search engines and usability for
              visitors.

              Design Inspiration: I am drawing inspiration from classic zines,
              aiming to convey the aesthetic of print and physical media in my
              website. My focus is on incorporating this style while maintaining
              a functional and accessible design. Interaction Design Thoughts:
              My interaction design so far has prioritized navigation. I have
              added features like jump links and plan to integrate similar
              elements, such as status bars, to enhance usability. I anticipate
              that the interaction experience of the website will evolve,
              becoming more complex. My main concern is ensuring that I do not
              lose sight of my website's core purpose as I introduce additional
              elements. Ultimately, I want the site to communicate my skills in
              an accessible way that does not overwhelm or frustrate users.
              Wireframes Reflection: I feel my original wireframes have not been
              fully realized yet, which is why I believe they still hold up
              well. However, I expect they will be challenged as more stylistic
              and structural elements are added to the website. I see my
              wireframes as placeholders, serving to guide development and
              prevent me from working aimlessly. I hold no illusion that they
              represent the final iteration of my website. Instead, I fully
              expect them to evolve as the design progresses. Website 1
              Development Reflection: The creation of Website 1 has been an
              interesting journey. While I have not found the implementation of
              languages particularly challenging, breaking down the design
              process into distinct layers rather than building component by
              component has been an adjustment. I often struggle with resisting
              the urge to add depth and complexity to the site prematurely,
              rather than broadening and refining it gradually. This has made it
              difficult to see my wireframes materialize both structurally and
              artistically. The disconnect between design and implementation,
              especially regarding structure, is a challenge I face—and one I
              believe others encounter as well. Semantic Markup and
              Microformatting: I find semantic HTML both fascinating and
              overwhelming. I frequently worry whether I am adding too much or
              too little, which can be exhausting. This struggle extends to
              microformatting, where similar concerns were even mentioned in the
              lecture videos. Despite this, I am proud of adhering to good
              semantic practices and avoiding hardcoding when organizing the
              structure or formatting. Key Accomplishments:

            <ul>
              <li>
                I am proud of the overall flow of my website, believing the
                navigation is simple, intuitive, and aligned with the website's
                purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                This focus on clear and accessible navigation is one of my core
                interaction principles, which I feel I have executed well.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Looking Ahead: My focus moving forward will be refining the
              layout, enhancing semantic markup, and continuing to align the
              design with the core principles of usability and accessibility.

              Aesthetically I am drawing inspiration from "Zines". I want the
              website to have the essence of physical media. I am particularly

              like my website to have that essence.

            <h5>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</h5>
            <p>
              The two articles I’ve chosen to engage with are Tataki and
              Glynos’s “Digital Divide Widens” and Kasapis’s “Internet Access is
              a Fundamental Right.” Both pieces address a pressing and often
              overlooked reality: technology and internet access should not be
              luxuries reserved for the wealthy elite. The idea that internet
              access is a fundamental right is one I’ve believed in for some
              time. Some might view this as idealistic or even privileged, but I
              believe it is a reasonable and necessary stance in our digital
              age. As Kasapis states, “Information and the access thereto, then,
              are two sides of the same coin, and few keep the currency” [1].
              This metaphor speaks volumes. Throughout history, the powerful
              have maintained control through exclusive ownership of valuable
              resources—land, capital, and, notably, knowledge. In today’s
              context, access to information and education holds similar weight.
              Without the internet, people are effectively locked out of these
              critical tools, limiting their social mobility and their perceived
              “value” in a system that equates worth with productivity and
              skill. Withholding internet access, therefore, is more than a
              logistical issue—it’s an ethical one. It can feel like denying
              someone the means to survive. This may sound dramatic, but the
              COVID-19 pandemic made the stakes very clear. As Tataki and Glynos
              point out, “The current pandemic has forced a transition online”
              [2]. For those without internet access, this shift meant the loss
              of jobs, education, and community.
            </p>
            <h5>Digital Inclusion</h5>
            <p>
              Digital inclusion is no longer optional. If people are not
              included, they will be left behind. According to UNESCO data cited
              by Tataki and Glynos, “Of all the students currently out of the
              classroom, 50%—or about 830 million—do not have access to a
              computer” [2]. These are “the most vulnerable among us,” and
              they’re being systematically excluded from the future. Their
              access to education (a right) is being taken away. In societies
              like ours, where digital literacy is as crucial as traditional
              literacy, being offline equates to being invisible. Historically,
              literacy was once reserved for the elite and intentionally denied
              to marginalised groups like slaves and women. Pihama and
              Lee-Morgan draw connections between colonisation, education, and
              the systematic denial of knowledge to Indigenous peoples [3]. The
              comparison is apt. Today, internet access plays a similar role in
              perpetuating exclusion. If governments don’t provide access to
              digital infrastructure, only the wealthy can participate in this
              new society. Think of it like transportation: if you own a car,
              you can take a job that’s further away. If the bus doesn’t reach
              your destination, you need a car. Internet access works the same
              way. If you don’t have it, you can’t reliably take on a remote
              job. The internet accelerates progress, but if access remains
              restricted by income and infrastructure, it will also accelerate
              inequality. I acknowledge that maintaining these systems requires
              resources. However, acknowledging complexity does not excuse
              inaction. This is a global issue with tangible, human
              consequences—and it deserves urgent attention and investment.

              Spyros Kasapis’s blog post, “Internet Access is a Fundamental
              Right. Especially Amidst a Pandemic,” presents a compelling case
              for digital inclusion by exposing how the COVID-19 pandemic
              illuminated deep-rooted inequalities in global internet access.
              Kasapis argues that internet connectivity is no longer a luxury—it
              is essential for meaningful participation in contemporary life. He
              equates digital access with basic human rights such as education
              and healthcare, stressing that without it, millions are
              effectively locked out of modern society [2]. The central aim of
              Kasapis’s piece is to reframe internet access as a fundamental
              human right. He calls on institutions such as the United Nations
              and Amnesty International to intervene, and notes that the Indian
              Supreme Court has already declared internet access a fundamental
              right. This move from commentary to advocacy demonstrates
              Kasapis’s intent not just to raise awareness, but to push for
              systemic, policy-level responses—particularly from governments
              tasked with safeguarding equality, especially during crises like
              the pandemic [2].
            </p>
            <p>
              Kasapis raises two critical questions for future consideration:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Economic and social: Should internet access be universally
                guaranteed regardless of income?
              </li>
              <li>
                Political: Who governs the internet, and under what rules?
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Stylistically, Kasapis opens with a quote from Salvador Allende,
              framing happiness as a right constrained by systemic inequality,
              which he later connects to digital exclusion. He uses contrast
              effectively throughout the article—for example, highlighting Jeff
              Bezos’s wealth beside the fact that billions lack digital access.
              These rhetorical choices ground his argument in both moral urgency
              and socio-political critique [2].
            </p>
            <p>
              The article is structured around a cause-and-effect framework:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The pandemic → heightened reliance on digital tools</li>
              <li>
                Reliance on digital tools → exclusion of those without internet
                access
              </li>
              <li>Exclusion → deepening structural inequality</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Kasapis’s insights resonate with larger discussions of digital
              capitalism and inequality. In my own reflections on his work, I
              was reminded of how historical exclusion from literacy mirrors
              modern digital disenfranchisement. As I wrote previously, access
              begets access. If infrastructure (e.g., buses, schools, or
              networks) doesn’t reach you, you need an alternative (e.g., a car,
              private education, a computer)—and alternatives require money. A
              similar analogy appears in Timo Seidl’s recent work on digital
              capitalism, which critiques the illusion of universal access in
              gig economies. As Seidl writes, “There is an Uber for everything,”
              but participation still assumes access to the digital
              infrastructures enabling such services [1]. Without that
              infrastructure, you’re excluded not just from convenience—but from
              entire economic and social systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kasapis’s arguments are also supported by major digital equity
              bodies. The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) estimates that
              nearly half the world’s population lacks reliable access, with
              affordability, infrastructure, and digital literacy being key
              barriers [3]. UNESCO has echoed these concerns, advocating not
              just for “access,” but for meaningful connectivity—emphasizing
              quality, reliability, and the ability to use the internet
              effectively in one’s daily life [4].
            </p>
            <p>
              Kasapis concludes by reminding us that the internet is not just a
              marketplace of ideas, but of labour and survival. In our global
              digital economy, technology saves time, time enables income, and
              income enables survival—but access to technology is still a
              gatekeeper. This paradox is central to modern digital inequality
              [2].
            </p>
            <p>
              In summary, Kasapis’s blog is a brief yet potent critique of the
              socio-political structures surrounding internet access. By framing
              connectivity as a human right essential to dignity and survival,
              he challenges us to rethink what inclusion truly means in the
              digital age. His argument is timely, persuasive, and
              crucial—particularly for policy makers, educators, and
              technologists tasked with building more equitable futures.

                African Feminists and Feminisms</em
              >
              offers a timely and powerful meditation on the intersections
              between digital technology, access, and feminist activism on the
              African continent. Set against the backdrop of the COVID-19
              pandemic, it critiques the illusion of digital neutrality and
              challenges the notion that the internet inherently democratizes
              communication. Instead, the authors position African feminist
              movements as essential to resisting and reshaping an internet that
              reflects existing inequalities [1].
            </p>
            <p>
              The article highlights how access to the internet is deeply
              politicized, particularly for women, LGBTIQA+ individuals, and
              other marginalized communities. Drawing on the October 2019
              “Making a Feminist Internet in Africa and the Diaspora” gathering,
              it blends personal narrative with collective experience to reframe
              internet governance as a lived concern rather than a purely
              institutional one [1].
            </p>
            <p>
              A major insight is its critique of techno-solutionism—the belief
              that digital tools alone can fix complex social problems. This
              aligns with critiques by thinkers such as Morozov and resonates
              with Spyros Kasapis’s framing of internet access as a human right
              [2]. Both texts argue that without addressing structural
              inequalities, digital “solutions” often reinforce the very issues
              they aim to resolve.
            </p>
            <p>
              The article also references Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s concept of
              the “danger of a single story” [3], challenging deficit-based
              narratives that frame African innovation as purely utilitarian.
              Instead, feminist internet spaces are shown to foster joy,
              creativity, and resistance. These gatherings confront dominant
              digital norms that marginalize Black, queer, fat, disabled, and
              other non-normative identities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Importantly, the internet is depicted as both a tool of oppression
              and a site for resistance. The text details how online
              gender-based violence is prevalent but underrecognized in African
              legal contexts. This gap between digital harm and legal recourse
              underscores the need for feminist frameworks that bridge online
              and offline experiences [1].
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, the article is a call to action, advocating for an
              internet where African feminists lead—not just participate. In a
              time of increasing digital dependency and isolation, creating
              inclusive and just online spaces is not aspirational—it is, as the
              authors assert, “crucial” [1].

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              When thinking about how our code matters in the context of
              decolonialism, it’s important to remember that code is not
              neutral. The tools, languages, and frameworks we use and the
              assumptions we embed in our designs all come from specific
              worldviews. These worldviews often reflect dominant, Western
              norms. As a developer and designer, I’ve started to reflect on
              what this means for my own practice, particularly when creating
              web-based projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the key things I’ve become more aware of is accessibility;
              not just in terms of screen readers or keyboard navigation, but in
              cultural accessibility too. Who is my code speaking to? Who is
              left out? Am I designing with assumptions about language, internet
              speed, device capability, or even ways of understanding space and
              interaction? In a decolonial approach, I have to question whose
              needs are centered in my work and whether I am reinforcing systems
              of exclusion through my design choices.
            </p>
            <p>
              This has influenced the way I approach interactivity, especially
              as I’ve started integrating JavaScript into my website. Initially,
              my site was a static HTML/CSS structure, which limited how users
              could interact with the content. Adding JavaScript forced me to
              rethink the layout and structure. I had to refactor parts of the
              site to allow for dynamic content updates, responsive feedback,
              and more intuitive navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, I implemented a JavaScript-based menu that adapts to
              screen size and user input. Instead of relying on visual cues
              only, I began considering how to provide sound or text feedback
              for users who might interact differently, whether due to
              disability, device limitations, or different cognitive
              preferences. This small change became a gateway to bigger
              questions about inclusive interaction design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incorporating JavaScript also helped me streamline the user
              experience. I could now use event listeners and conditionals to
              guide users through tasks without overwhelming them with static
              content all at once. Forms became smarter. Feedback became
              immediate. But even here, I had to pause: was I relying too
              heavily on JavaScript in a way that made the site unusable for
              people on low-end devices or slow networks? Decolonial thinking
              reminded me that performance is not just a technical concern but
              it’s also a justice issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, my development process is becoming less about “adding
              features” and more about asking better questions. JavaScript isn’t
              just a tool, it’s a medium that can either reinforce or resist
              dominant design norms. As a developer committed to ethical,
              inclusive practice, I want to use it to empower, not exclude.
            </p>
            <p>
              This means staying critical of my own assumptions, seeking out
              alternative ways of thinking about interaction, and being
              intentional about whose voices and needs are considered in every
              line of code. That’s what decolonial coding looks like to me.

              Let’s imagine the internet as a meta-country—a nation without
              borders but with citizens, laws, infrastructure, and consequences.
              If that’s the case, then an ethical internet is a place I would
              want to live in: an environment conducive to good living,
              fairness, and well-being. It would embody the following
              principles:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Inclusivity:</strong> An ethical internet is
                non-discriminatory—accessible and welcoming regardless of race,
                gender, disability, language, or location.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Respect for User Rights:</strong> This includes control
                over one’s content, freedom of expression, and digital privacy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Dark Patterns:</strong> Platforms should not rely on
                deceptive design to manipulate user behavior for profit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consequences and Speed Bumps:</strong> Ethical design
                includes mechanisms that slow harmful behavior. Just like how
                speed bumps make you stop where speed limits don’t—especially
                for the wealthy or powerful who can ignore fines—ethical systems
                should include enforceable constraints, not just warnings.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              An ethical internet, to me, is one where the rights, dignity, and
              safety of users come before profit, power, or unchecked
              surveillance. It’s not only about access to the internet, but also
              what kind of access, who controls it, and what values it reflects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The article <em>Making a Feminist Internet in Africa</em> [1]
              shaped my thinking significantly. It argues that unless we
              consciously redesign digital spaces, the internet will
              reproduce—and even amplify—existing structural inequalities. A
              feminist internet is not just about women; it’s about challenging
              power imbalances, especially those rooted in patriarchy,
              colonialism, and racism. An ethical internet should amplify
              marginalized voices, not silence them through harassment or
              algorithmic bias. This requires platforms that are built with care
              and consent at their core.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consent is a major pillar of ethical design. Shoshana Zuboff’s
              <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> [2] describes how
              platforms like Facebook and TikTok extract and monetize data
              without meaningful consent, turning people into resources. Ethical
              alternatives must emphasize data transparency, user ownership, and
              robust regulation to prevent exploitative surveillance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Accessibility is another key principle. An ethical internet
              ensures that people of all abilities, languages, and cultural
              backgrounds can participate fully. This includes features like
              screen reader compatibility, mobile-friendly design, multilingual
              content, and affordable access. This aligns with the concept of
              “universal design”, which centers the needs of the most vulnerable
              users as a standard rather than an afterthought.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, the internet should promote collective well-being. This
              doesn’t mean enforcing a single set of moral beliefs, but rather
              protecting pluralism while safeguarding users from harm. Platforms
              should be held accountable when their algorithms spread hate or
              misinformation. For instance, Zeynep Tufekci noted how YouTube’s
              recommendation system often pushes users toward radical content to
              maximize engagement, regardless of the consequences [3]. Ethical
              platforms would prioritize human rights over metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
              In essence, an ethical internet is not just about better
              regulations or guidelines—it’s about reimagining digital space
              through the lens of care, equity, and justice. It should be shaped
              collaboratively, by everyone it affects: engineers, artists,
              educators, activists, and everyday users. That’s the kind of
              internet I want to help build.

              <p>
                User Interface (UI) refers to the point of interaction between
                humans and computers, encompassing visual and auditory elements
                such as typography, icons, buttons, animations, and sounds [1].
                The design of a UI is closely intertwined with the User
                Experience (UX), which is the emotional and functional response
                users have while engaging with a system. While a conceptual
                distinction between UI and UX can be made, they are often best
                evaluated together in practice. In the contemporary digital
                landscape, websites are intentionally constructed to guide user
                interaction, often in service of commercial objectives.
                Profit-driven design is not inherently unethical; however, the
                strategies used to secure profit can tread the line between
                persuasive and manipulative. Furthermore, because legislation
                frequently lags behind technological innovation, defining
                ethical boundaries in digital design remains a complex and
                evolving challenge. This essay critically analyses the UI and UX
                design of the South African supermarket chain Makro’s website.
                It evaluates the site’s adherence to key interface principles,
                the psychological strategies underlying its user experience, and
                the ethical implications of its design decisions.

            <section aria-labelledby="ui-heading">
              <h3 id="ui-heading">User Interface (UI)</h3>
              <p>
                According to core UI principles covered in the course, an
                effective interface should be intuitive, simple, and consistent
                [7]. An "intuitive" interface allows users to navigate without
                prior training, often achieved by adhering to established design
                conventions. "Simple" refers to a clean and manageable
                information layout, while "consistent" design ensures users do
                not need to relearn functions across pages. Makro’s website, as
                an e-commerce and catalogue platform, follows widely accepted
                web conventions. The homepage presents a broad array of products
                to inform users of available offerings. Features such as search,
                filtering options, and a shopping cart provide clear pathways to
                interaction and conversion. The site excels in consistency:
                product listings are uniformly structured, with transparent
                banner images, long-form names, pricing, and customer ratings.
                Although some product names are lengthy, this choice prioritizes
                informational clarity over minimalism. Filtering tools,
                categorized by price, brand, and rating, are predictably
                structured across sections, reducing cognitive load and
                supporting smooth user navigation. In terms of simplicity, the
                site employs a restrained colour palette (black text on a white
                background, with yellow accents), readable fonts, and
                universally understandable icons. Importantly, icons are always
                paired with text descriptions, reinforcing the emphasis on
                accessibility and clarity. However, the homepage lacks a strong
                visual hierarchy, a key UI principle defined by visual weight,
                contrast, spacing, and font size [2]. With numerous banners and
                categories vying for attention, users may struggle to prioritize
                content. The absence of contrast diminishes guidance, resulting
                in a page where all elements appear equally important, thus
                weakening overall navigability. In summary, Makro’s UI is
                largely intuitive, consistent, and user-friendly, though it
                would benefit from improved visual hierarchy to better guide
                user attention, specifically with the Home Page.

            <section aria-labelledby="ux-heading">
              <h3 id="ux-heading">User Experience (UX)</h3>
              <p>
                UX design draws heavily on psychological principles intended to
                guide user behaviour. Notable among these are Hick’s Law, the
                Zeigarnik Effect, Fitts’s Law, and the Serial Position Effect
                [8]. According to other sources other relevant ideas include the
                active user Jakob’s Law [3]. Makro’s website demonstrates
                thoughtful application of these principles to enhance usability
                and encourage user engagement. Hick’s Law suggests that too many
                options can overwhelm users. While Makro’s homepage presents a
                wide selection of content, it does so in a well-structured
                layout that mitigates confusion. During the checkout process,
                unrelated options are removed, maintaining user focus and
                supporting conversion. The Zeigarnik Effect, which posits that
                incomplete tasks are more memorable than completed ones, is
                utilized through persistent “View All” and “Shop Now” prompts,
                encouraging continued engagement. The inclusion of a progress
                bar during checkout leverages this effect to nudge users toward
                finalizing purchases. Jakob’s Law highlights users’ preference
                for familiar interfaces. Makro adheres to established e-commerce
                conventions, allowing users to rely on prior knowledge. This
                aligns with the “active user” principle, which recognizes that
                most users learn by doing rather than reading manuals. In
                contrast, Fitts’s Law, which relates to the time required to
                move to a target area (i.e., clickable buttons), is less
                effectively implemented. On desktop, the category icons lead to
                dropdowns rather than direct navigation, adding unnecessary
                steps that hinder usability. More broadly, the UX reflects an
                understanding of the intended user, the general consumer. The
                site avoids polarizing aesthetics or statements, instead opting
                for neutrality and accessibility. It is clearly designed for
                wide appeal, aligning with Makro’s positioning as a mass-market
                retailer.
              </p>

            <section aria-labelledby="ui-ux-intersection-heading">
              <h3 id="ui-ux-intersection-heading">UI & UX Intersection</h3>
              <p>
                Makro’s interface and experience coalesce to support clear and
                frictionless navigation. Despite the size and variety of its
                catalogue, the website manages to maintain a relatively clean
                and structured layout. By prioritizing accurate product
                information and minimizing the influence of individual brand
                aesthetics, Makro maintains its identity as a neutral
                distributor. For example, although products like iPhones are
                sold, items often associated with status, the platform itself
                avoids adopting such branding cues. This deliberate neutrality
                reinforces the platform’s accessibility and functionality over
                prestige. The consistency of design supports predictability,
                while the subtle integration of persuasive UX strategies
                enhances usability without undermining user autonomy. The result
                is a platform that balances functionality, simplicity, and
                neutrality in service of its commercial goals. In summary, the
                design principles of both UI and UX are met but not exceeded.
                For example, the simplicity is not minimalism. All the relevant
                standards are addressed when needed but nothing more or less
                than what is needed is done.

              <h3 id="ethics-heading">Ethics</h3>
              <p>
                Ethical digital design requires both the inclusion of diverse,
                respectful content and the avoidance of manipulative practices.
                As defined by UX Primer, ethical UX prioritizes user autonomy,
                privacy, and well-being [4]. Makro’s website maintains an
                inclusive tone by avoiding targeted messaging and focusing
                primarily on product information. While the occasional marketing
                banner features diverse individuals, the general aesthetic
                remains universal and product-centred. This reinforces a broad,
                accessible appeal that does not alienate or overly target any
                demographic. Importantly, the site refrains from dark patterns,
                design tactics that deceive or coerce users. There are no false
                claims of urgency, limited availability, or misleading calls to
                action. Notifications are opt-in rather than disruptive, and
                users retain full control over their experience. Even
                transitions to third-party payment windows are clearly
                indicated, with easy navigation back to the main site. Respect
                for the user’s autonomy is clear. As noted in UX Matters, the
                distinction between persuasion and manipulation lies in the
                preservation of transparency and agency [5]. As stated
                previously, clear and correct information is a key component of
                the site. Transparency is present. Makro’s design choices
                clearly fall on the ethical side of this line. The site
                encourages purchases without obscuring information, misleading
                users, or restricting freedom of choice. The user does not have
                to create an account to browse or share their location if they
                don’t want to. Notifications are opt-in. Everything about the
                site is geared to not manipulating the user but simply guiding
                them. The user is able to opt out of a decision at any time and
                is informed when a decision will be final. There is further
                information available on return policies, delivery dates and
                more. Ethical design basically means making conscious design
                decisions that do good and do not harm anyone, either
                intentionally or unintentionally. The design of the site is
                intentional, and the intention is neutrality as a brand
                representation. Transparency of the process with regards to the
                product, price and more. Intentionality of respecting the user’s
                agency and choice. The website respects human rights, effort and
                experience as laid out in the Ethical Design Manifesto [6].

              <h3 id="conclusion-heading">Conclusion</h3>
              <p>
                Makro’s website offers a compelling example of ethical,
                user-centred design in the context of e-commerce. Its interface
                is intuitive, consistent, and largely simple, though
                improvements in visual hierarchy would enhance clarity. The site
                applies psychological principles to guide users effectively
                through its vast product offerings without resorting to coercive
                or deceptive techniques. Importantly, its ethical approach
                respects user autonomy and promotes transparency. In achieving
                its commercial objectives, Makro manages to create a user
                experience that is both functional and principled. Makro’s
                design succeeds not because it is flashy or innovative, but
                because it is quietly functional, inclusive, and respectful. In
                a commercial world where manipulation is often normalized, this
                restraint is its most ethical feature.

            <p>
              The essence of Outer Wilds is exploration for the sake of
              curiosity and connection. This reflection analyses how the music
              (distinct from the broader sound design) deeply supports and
              enhances these themes.
            </p>

            <h3>Everything Is Connected</h3>
            <img src="images/Log.png" alt="Image of the Ship's Log" />
            <p>
              The idea that everything is connected in Outer Wilds is central to
              its macro-level design and encourages the player to explore. This
              is exemplified by the ship’s log (above), a gameplay feature
              designed to help players piece together the overarching mystery.
              The music supports this sense of connection by being embedded into
              the core of the game’s design, rather than existing as a passive
              background layer. Composer Andrew Prahlow stated in an interview
              with Jesse Vitelli of Prima Games.com that he explicitly aimed to
              avoid creating “wallpaper” (Stuart, 2020) music that loops without
              intention, as is common in many games.
            </p>
            <p>
              While numerous games feature memorable soundtracks—such as Hollow
              Knight or the Super Mario series—these tend to serve as
              complements to the world rather than components of it. Prahlow
              approached the Outer Wilds score as a film composer might: music
              is triggered only when it serves a narrative or emotional purpose.
              As a result, much of the game is spent in relative silence, with
              only the ambient sounds of the ship or the player’s spacesuit
              audible. This deliberate minimalism contributes to the game’s
              cinematic feel, even though it lacks traditional cutscenes, voice
              acting, or photorealistic visuals. While art direction plays a
              significant role, the music’s restraint and timing are equally
              critical to the game’s atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
              This film-score approach supports the idea that Outer Wilds is
              intended to be a singular, impactful experience—not necessarily a
              game to be replayed or mastered, but one to be felt.
            </p>

            <h3>Homeliness and Vastness</h3>
            <p>
              As a lone traveller trapped in a time loop, the player explores a
              small solar system and uncovers the story of a lost civilization
              known as the Nomai. The game masterfully balances feelings of
              comfort and vastness—two contrasting sensations—and the music is
              integral to achieving this. Tracks like “Timber Hearth” and
              “Campfire Song” evoke warmth and familiarity, while pieces
              associated with the Nomai introduce tones that feel alien,
              ancient, and haunting. Prahlow, in an interview with Game
              Developer.com described “Timber Hearth” as grounded in a core idea
              of “relaxation,” and explained that the Nomai music was designed
              to sound like “a piano being ripped apart in space.”
              (Prahlow,2019)
            </p>
            <p>
              The track “The Museum” blends motifs from both “Timber Hearth” and
              the Nomai themes—featuring synth drones, piano, and a banjo riff.
              It musically symbolizes the intersection of the Hearthians and the
              Nomai, reinforcing the game’s theme of cosmic connection. The game
              is often isolating. The music, or lack thereof, reinforces this
              solitude. When “End Times” begins to play, it marks a profound
              moment of reflection and acceptance as the universe resets once
              again.
            </p>

            <h3>Music and Mechanics</h3>
            <img
              src="images/Signalscope.jpg"
              alt="Image of the Signalscope being used"
            />
            <p>
              The game’s sense of isolation is not only countered by “End
              Times,” but also by the signalscope—perhaps the strongest argument
              for how the music is integrated into gameplay itself. At any
              moment, the player can pull out the signalscope and detect the
              musical signatures of fellow travellers playing their instruments.
              These diegetic songs remind the player that they are not truly
              alone. More than just a comfort, the signalscope is a mechanical
              tool for exploration, functioning as a musical compass that leads
              players to key locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whenever the player enters an area of Nomai ruins, a piano motif
              begins to play. According to Prahlow, this was designed to “help
              you notice that you’re in a place of importance.” This subtle
              musical cue encourages exploration, reinforcing the central
              mechanic of uncovering knowledge. If the player becomes stuck,
              they can rely on the presence of these fragments of music to guide
              them. The mechanical design of the ship and jetpack is intuitive
              and polished, and the music complements these systems to amplify
              the joy of movement and discovery.
            </p>
            <h3>The Finale: A Symphony of Connection</h3>
            <p>
              The final sequence of Outer Wilds is emotionally profound and
              musically climactic. As the player exits the time loop by removing
              the warp core, “End Times” reprises—but this time, it is
              transformed. Each traveller is revealed to have been playing the
              same song all along, and together, they gather around a final
              campfire as the universe collapses, and a new Big Bang begins.
              This moment is underscored by a reimagined version of the main
              theme: now synthesized, expansive, and emotionally weighted. The
              music mirrors the narrative’s resolution—a blend of grounded
              intimacy and cosmic scope. Beginning with acoustic, folk-inspired
              melodies and evolving into something more ambient and
              otherworldly, the score encapsulates the lifespan of both
              civilizations and the emotional journey of the player.

            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-05-14">
              14 May 2025

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              Disco Elysium stands apart as an RPG that dares to strip the genre
              to its philosophical roots. The game has truly simple
              mechanics—it's a point-and-click, largely text-based game, but
              beneath this minimalist surface lies a richly complex narrative
              structure. Rather than focusing on combat or loot, Disco Elysium
              leans heavily into narratology over ludology. In other words, it
              prioritizes story and character development over traditional
              gameplay systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              will discuss how Disco Elysium fits comfortably within the
              confines of the RPG classification but challenges the stereotypes
              of the genre. According to Sam Liberty’s article RPG’s have the
              following defining features:
            </p>
            <p>
              - You play as a specific, predefined character. - Character
              advancement/customization. - The character has game statistics. -
              The player makes decisions for the character.
            </p>
            <p>
              All these requirements are met. The player plays as a washed-up
              detective with no memory of who he is. This may sound limiting
              compared to RPGs that let you create your own hero, but Disco
              Elysium turns that on its head. The game offers a unique kind of
              character customization: instead of upgrading weapons or armour,
              you are upgrading your own mind. Progression is deeply
              introspective. Your “skill tree” is really a thought cabinet, and
              your stats—Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics—are directly
              tied to your personality and how your character processes the
              world around him.
            </p>
            <img src="images/DiceCheck.jpg" alt="Image of a Dice Check" />
            <p>
              This is where Disco Elysium takes its boldest step. Your build
              doesn’t just influence what you do in the game—it shapes what you
              perceive. A highly empathetic character will notice things others
              miss in conversations, while one with high Inland Empire might
              start hallucinating. One early scene has the player examine the
              body of a hanged man—a central murder victim. If your character’s
              Inland Empire (a surreal, intuitive stat) is high enough, the
              corpse starts talking back. It’s not just a hallucination—it’s a
              moment that fuses character psychology with world interaction,
              blending narrative depth with mechanical consequence. Dialogue
              options shift dramatically depending on your stats.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of Disco Elysium’s most striking mechanics is the internal
              thought system, where different parts of the protagonist’s
              psyche—like Authority, Empathy, or Inland Empire—interject during
              conversations, shaping dialogue choices and even how information
              is interpreted. This transforms typical RPG dialogue trees into a
              negotiation with yourself, tying mechanics directly into the
              game’s themes of identity and instability. This turns each
              playthrough into a fundamentally different experience, not because
              the world changes, but because your character’s lens on it does.
              This links to the philosophical nature of the game and the
              relativist idea that perception shapes reality. The player can
              continually choose to change their perception by doing drugs,
              putting skill points into other In this sense, the game feels
              infinite—not in terms of world size or quest quantity, but in how
              deeply it allows for roleplay and internal variance. The dragons
              you’re slaying aren’t monsters—they’re your own insecurities,
              delusions, and traumas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Disco Elysium also draws inspiration from traditional tabletop
              RPGs (TTRPGs) rather than modern computer RPGs (CRPGs or ARPGs).
              The character sheet is clear and familiar, the game uses literal
              dice rolls for checks, and the art—expressionist, painterly—is
              evocative of analogue play. The game as a relatively small map,
              compared to other CRPGs like open world of Skyrim, and apots a
              topdown view, almost like looking at the board of a board game.
              This analogue aesthetic, paired with heavy textual storytelling,
              builds a tactile sense of immersion. It's familiar yet strange,
              like reading a novel with stats.
            </p>

            />
            <p>
              In Roger Caillois’ terms, Disco Elysium is squarely in the
              category of mimicry—the game is about adopting a role and fully
              inhabiting it. But this mimicry is deeply reflexive: by playing a
              character grappling with identity and meaning, you end up
              examining your own. The game’s absurdist realism and critical
              stance on politics, ethics, and society push you to engage not
              just with the fiction, but with real-world systems of power and
              marginalization. Ultimately, Disco Elysium is a philosophical
              RPG—a rare game that blends simple mechanics with existential
              weight. It doesn’t just let you play a character; it forces you to
              become one, flaws and all. And in doing so, it redefines what an
              RPG can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              It shares some of the weaknesses common to narrative-heavy
              RPGs—especially in the midgame, where the sheer amount of lore,
              politics, and side content can feel overwhelming or even aimless.
              When you're just trying to find your gun, being pulled into dense
              ideological debates can feel frustrating. But this is also the
              point: Disco Elysium is not a power fantasy—it’s a vulnerability
              fantasy. By slowing down the pace and demanding intellectual
              engagement, it asks players to reflect rather than react. In doing
              so, it expands the RPG genre into something stranger, more honest,
              and deeply human.

            <p>
              <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> is a masterclass in tutorialization,
              especially in how it introduces new mechanics. Rather than using
              walls of text, it teaches players through level design, visual
              feedback, and interactive elements that feel natural and playful.
              This analysis breaks down those teaching techniques, with a focus
              on the tutorial and Freezeflame Galaxy.
            </p>

            <h3>The Tutorial Level: Learning Through Play</h3>
            <p>
              The game begins with a low-stakes challenge: catching three
              bunnies on a small spherical planet. It’s a fun and seemingly
              simple task, but it cleverly teaches core skills—movement, camera
              control, and navigation on non-Euclidean terrain—without any
              explicit instruction. Sutton-Smith’s concept of “frivolous play”
              fits well here: it’s enjoyable for its own sake, but it carries
              deep lessons.
            </p>
            <p>
              The spherical planet subtly introduces players to a gravitational
              system that doesn’t follow the usual 3D platformer rules. By
              making the learning space playful and risk-free, the game fosters
              experimentation and comfort with new mechanics.
            </p>

            <h3>Shake It Up: Introducing the Launch Star</h3>
            <p>
              Shortly after, players encounter a Launch Star that requires
              shaking the Wii Remote—introducing motion controls as a central
              mechanic. This blends seamlessly into gameplay and is introduced
              in a low-pressure environment. Galaxy also uses minimal but
              effective text, often paired with icons or animations for clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each tutorial planet is small and contained. This avoids confusion
              and ensures each mechanic is tied to satisfying actions like
              launching or smashing crystals, reinforcing understanding through
              immediate feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>Visual Feedback and Camera Framing</h3>
            <p>
              The camera plays a major role in communicating feedback. For
              example, when vibrating obelisks are activated, the camera zooms
              out to show the entire effect before snapping back to Mario. This
              sequence shows cause and effect without words.
            </p>
            <p>
              The obelisks’ visual similarity to breakable crystals also
              encourages experimentation. This kind of intuitive cueing helps
              players discover mechanics naturally—without explicit instruction.
            </p>

            <h3>Case Study: Freezeflame Galaxy</h3>
            <p>
              Later in the game, <em>Freezeflame Galaxy</em> demonstrates
              scaffolded learning with increasing complexity:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>First Star:</strong> Introduces the Ice Flower. Players
                shake the Wii Remote to skate and then use the Ice Flower to
                freeze water into platforms. Environmental design gently forces
                players to engage with these mechanics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Second Star:</strong> Introduces the Fire Flower.
                Players light torches to open gates, slightly increasing the
                difficulty and requiring more interpretation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Third Star:</strong> Combines both mechanics. This is a
                final test of everything learned, reinforcing mastery through
                application.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The level design and progression ensure the player is never
              confused, while consistently learning and experimenting in new
              contexts.
            </p>

            <h3>Genre and Innovation</h3>
            <p>
              Galaxy is a 3D platformer at heart, but by leveraging new
              technology—like spherical level geometry and motion controls—it
              redefined what the genre could be. These shifts required strong
              tutorialization to bring players along for the ride. Its intuitive
              design was essential for making players feel empowered rather than
              overwhelmed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The galactic theme supported this complexity, giving a narrative
              excuse for variety and physics-bending mechanics. The game
              expanded the genre without abandoning its roots.
            </p>

            <h3>Guidance Without Handholding</h3>
            <p>
              Even small features like level preview clips help orient players.
              The game respects players’ intelligence, trusting them to learn
              through curiosity and engagement. This is guidance—not
              handholding.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Super Mario Galaxy exemplifies how
              elegant tutorial design, visual communication, and playfulness can
              work together to guide players through novel mechanics without
              overwhelming them. It creates a sense of discovery, not
              instruction—and that’s what makes it brilliant.
