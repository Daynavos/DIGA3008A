          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              Setting up GitHub was a straightforward process. I found it
              fascinating to discover how simple it is to publish a web page.
              This demystified the process of creating websites, for which I am
              grateful. I read “As We May Think at 65,” along with articles
              about the dot-com bubble and Web 2.0. These three readings
              complement each other well. One key takeaway for me was the
              personal aspect explored in both “Think 65” and “Web 2.0.” Bush
              envisioned access to information mimicking the human brain, aiming
              for a dynamic thought process rather than the hierarchical
              structure of alphabetized lists. I believe Hypermedia is the
              closest we've come to replicating the human process of jumping
              from one thought to another. The personal aspect, however, is what
              intrigues me the most. Web 2.0 focuses on making the web an
              interactive and personal experience. While this has many benefits,
              a concerning truth is that much of this personalization is
              profit-driven. Personalized ads are a prime example, though the
              implications go far beyond this. Main Concerns:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Ecosystems of Conformity: Within the web, ecosystems are being
                created where people are shown only what they want to see and
                are reinforced in their beliefs. This could allow harmful views
                to thrive unchecked.
              </li>
              <li>
                Capitalist Overtones: The dot-com bubble illustrates how much of
                the web is driven by publicly traded companies. Their profits
                depend on continuous growth, which drives tactics aimed at
                capturing attention and increasing time spent online. Such
                practices can foster addiction and unsafe habits.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As a result, the web has become an overwhelming space. While
              Bush's vision of dynamic information retrieval has been achieved,
              it is often overshadowed by the noise created by profit-driven
              motives. This constant growth desired by tech companies seems
              unsustainable, and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century
              signals the risks of unchecked expansion.

              A reflection on Moulthrop's "Hypertext and the Laws of Media".
            </h4>
            <time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-24">
              24 February 2025
            </time>

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to
              Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the
              political, social, and cultural implications of this new form of
              media. With each of McLuhan’s four laws, Moulthrop makes it clear
              that the "revolution" is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and
              not truly fueled by intellectual engagement. This, however, seems
              to be the case with all media the world has ever encountered.
              Where there is media, there will be propaganda. Where there is
              information, it will be manipulated and withheld. Hypertext is not
              immune to this, and the influence seems to be greater since more
              and more information can be consumed faster, leading to
              misinformation and propaganda all around What does hypertext
              enhance? The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new form of
              media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big
              enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closely simulate a
              human thought process. Nonlinear information retrieval and
              intertextuality skyrocketed. This is constantly improving and can
              be seen in activities like the Wikirace. What does hypertext
              render obsolete? Moulthrop states that hypertext has not rendered
              other media obsolete but has caused a significant shift in how
              people choose to engage with information. Many books have been
              converted to a hypertext format, where it is easy to jump from one
              chapter or topic to another. Hypertext has enhanced physical media
              and is slowly replacing it, with environmental concerns and
              convenience being big driving factors in today’s time. What does
              hypertext retrieve? Moulthrop states that hypertext is more
              interactive than books but less so than TV. He claims that
              hypertext has almost "fetched" old literacy and brought it into
              the interactive era. What happens when hypertext reaches its
              limit? McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed to its extreme,
              it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea to
              hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open,
              participatory network, it has increasingly been controlled by
              corporate and institutional interests. Links:

            <h5>What does interaction mean to you?</h5>

            Interaction, for the purposes of this course, has been defined as
            the ability to meaningfully change the state of something. This
            definition suits me well. I do, however, feel that this definition
            is geared towards excluding books and film. I see the value of this
            exclusion since the nature of these media is very linear and static.
            However, I believe that these forms of media can be included with an
            asterisk since the way in which you choose to interact with the
            media can change its influence on you, even if it does not truly
            change the media itself. Nonetheless, I think it is prudent to
            exclude these "static media" from our definition.

              User Alignment: The primary goal of my portfolio website is to
              attract employment opportunities in technical fields such as
              Software Development, Game Design, or Web Development. My target
              audience consists of potential employers seeking candidates
              withtechnical skills and creative problem-solving abilities. To
              effectively engage these users, my portfolio must clearly
              communicate my expertise while providing a seamless and engaging
              browsing experience. Site Content Mapping: To organize my
              portfolio effectively, I have structured the content into
              different skill-based categories:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Software: Birds—a project showcasing my software development
                skills.
              </li>
              <li>
                Game Design:
                <ul>
                  <li>Games—a collection of games I have worked on.</li>
                  <li>Itch—a link to my Itch.io profile for game projects.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal Projects: Music—showcasing my personal creative
                projects outside of software and game development.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Each section will highlight my skills and accomplishments in the
            respective domain, making it easy for employers to quickly assess my
            capabilities. User Experience Focus: Employers often browse multiple
            portfolios when searching for candidates. To ensure my portfolio
            stands out, I aim to create an experience that is both visually
            appealing and functionally efficient. Key considerations include:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Easy Navigation: Employers should be able to locate relevant
                sections without unnecessary clicks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Performance Optimization: A fast-loading website ensures a
                smooth and frustration-free experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Intuitive Design: The site should not only look good but also
                feel good to use, providing an enjoyable interaction for the
                user.
              </li>
            </ol>

            Interface Elements: The interface design focuses on two primary
            aspects:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Aesthetics: Inspired by the DIY, collage-style aesthetic of
                zines, my portfolio will feature a creative and visually unique
                layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Functionality: Seamless navigation will enable users to explore
                content quickly while ensuring my skills and projects are
                clearly showcased.
              </li>
            </ul>
            The goal is to strike a balance between creativity and usability,
            making the site memorable while remaining professional and
            accessible. Development Progress Reflection: This week, my focus has
            been on familiarizing myself with HTML and starting to build the
            foundational structure of the site. While the current version is
            still rough, progress is being made towards refining the layout and
            content organization. One area needing more attention is the
            implementation of semantic HTML strategies. This will be my focus in
            the coming week as I work toward making the site more structured and
            accessible. By improving semantic markup, I aim to enhance both
            readability for search engines and usability for visitors.

            <p>
              Design Inspiration: I am drawing inspiration from classic zines,
              aiming to convey the aesthetic of print and physical media in my
              website. My focus is on incorporating this style while maintaining
              a functional and accessible design. Interaction Design Thoughts:
              My interaction design so far has prioritized navigation. I have
              added features like jump links and plan to integrate similar
              elements, such as status bars, to enhance usability. I anticipate
              that the interaction experience of the website will evolve,
              becoming more complex. My main concern is ensuring that I do not
              lose sight of my website's core purpose as I introduce additional
              elements. Ultimately, I want the site to communicate my skills in
              an accessible way that does not overwhelm or frustrate users.
              Wireframes Reflection: I feel my original wireframes have not been
              fully realized yet, which is why I believe they still hold up
              well. However, I expect they will be challenged as more stylistic
              and structural elements are added to the website. I see my
              wireframes as placeholders, serving to guide development and
              prevent me from working aimlessly. I hold no illusion that they
              represent the final iteration of my website. Instead, I fully
              expect them to evolve as the design progresses. Website 1
              Development Reflection: The creation of Website 1 has been an
              interesting journey. While I have not found the implementation of
              languages particularly challenging, breaking down the design
              process into distinct layers rather than building component by
              component has been an adjustment. I often struggle with resisting
              the urge to add depth and complexity to the site prematurely,
              rather than broadening and refining it gradually. This has made it
              difficult to see my wireframes materialize both structurally and
              artistically. The disconnect between design and implementation,
              especially regarding structure, is a challenge I face—and one I
              believe others encounter as well. Semantic Markup and
              Microformatting: I find semantic HTML both fascinating and
              overwhelming. I frequently worry whether I am adding too much or
              too little, which can be exhausting. This struggle extends to
              microformatting, where similar concerns were even mentioned in the
              lecture videos. Despite this, I am proud of adhering to good
              semantic practices and avoiding hardcoding when organizing the
              structure or formatting. Key Accomplishments:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                I am proud of the overall flow of my website, believing the
                navigation is simple, intuitive, and aligned with the website's
                purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                This focus on clear and accessible navigation is one of my core
                interaction principles, which I feel I have executed well.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Looking Ahead: My focus moving forward will be refining the layout,
            enhancing semantic markup, and continuing to align the design with
            the core principles of usability and accessibility.

            <p>
              Aesthetically I am drawing inspiration from "Zines". I want the
              website to have the essence of physical media. I am particularly
              interested in the style of collages and screen printing and would
              like my website to have that essence.

            <h5>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right</h5>
            <p>
              This is a thought I’ve had for quite a while. It might seem
              idealistic or maybe even privileged, but it makes sense. I believe
              the following excerpt sums up the importance of this right:
              “Information and the access thereto, then, are two sides of the
              same coin, and few keep the currency.” The rich and powerful have
              always found ways to stay in control, whether ethically or not.
              Possessing what has value (for example land, capital, or
              knowledge) has historically equated to having power and status. In
              today’s world, information and education are among the most
              valuable things to possess and accessing them is next to
              impossible without the internet. Withholding information, or more
              specifically, the access to it, prevents people from advancing
              their “value.” And since the systems we live in require you to be
              “valuable” in order to survive, this withholding becomes almost
              akin to stripping someone of their right to live. I know how
              dramatic that may sound but considering the context of the
              pandemic (as discussed in the blog I’m referencing), it might not
              seem so far-fetched. During the pandemic, people without internet
              access were often unable to keep working, meaning their
              livelihoods were directly threatened. The digital divide has
              always been closely tied to the wealth gap, yet it doesn’t seem to
              receive the same level of attention or urgency.
            </p>
            <h5>Digital Inclusion</h5>
            <p>
              If people are not included, they will be left behind. The rich and
              powerful define what it means to be successful, and they often
              purposefully exclude those without access to resources. Technology
              is the latest manifestation of this cycle. The rapid pace of
              progress, accelerated by the internet, has made digital literacy a
              necessity. It’s become something we assume everyone should have,
              just like reading. But just as literacy was once deliberately
              withheld from the masses, access to technology and the internet is
              now limited by financial and infrastructural constraints. If
              governments don’t provide access to digital infrastructure, only
              the wealthy can participate in this new society. Think of it like
              transportation: if you own a car, you can take a job that’s
              further away. If the bus doesn’t reach your destination, you need
              a car. Internet access works the same way. If you don’t have it,
              you can’t reliably take on a remote job. Restricting access to the
              tools we use to define and drive progress only deepens inequality.
              I’m aware that all these systems require money to maintain, and I
              don’t claim to have all the answers. But I stand firm in believing
              that this is an issue we must take seriously and work to fix.

            <p>
              Spyros Kasapis’s blog post, “Internet Access is a Fundamental
              Right. Especially Amidst a Pandemic”, presents a compelling
              argument for digital inclusion, framed within the context of
              social inequality made clearer by the COVID-19 pandemic. The blog
              claims that internet access is not just a technological tool, but
              a necessity for participation in society. Kasapis equates internet
              access to human rights such as education and healthcare arguing
              that without it, millions are effectively locked out of modern
              life. Kasapis’s central aim is to reframe internet access as a
              fundamental human right, not a luxury. Sayin that institutions
              like the United Nations and Amnesty should act in ensuring access.
              He states that the Indian Supreme court has already taken such
              action. His aim is not only to raise awareness but to urge
              systemic responses, particularly from governments, to ensure
              digital access for all, especially considering crisis conditions
              like the pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>He also introduces two larger questions for future discourse:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Economic and social: Should internet access be universally
                guaranteed regardless of income?
              </li>
              <li>
                Political: Who governs the internet, and under what rules?
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>(These are the two questions posited with any change ever)</p>
            <p>
              Kasapis uses a persuasive, socio-political lens to structure his
              blog. He begins with an evocative quote from Salvador Allende,
              framing happiness as a right obstructed by economic inequality,
              then pivots to extend this logic to digital access. He employs an
              appeal to authority (e.g., referencing international legal bodies)
              to ground his claims, while also using contrast to highlight
              disparities: Jeff Bezos’s success is juxtaposed with the digital
              exclusion of half the world. The piece moves in a cause-effect
              logic. Pandemic leads to a reliance on digital tools which leads
              to exclusion of those without internet which leads to widening
              inequality and so on. By doing so, Kasapis constructs a logical,
              morally urgent narrative that culminates in a call for governance,
              equity, and digital democracy. In my own blog response, I
              reflected on how digital exclusion mirrors earlier forms of
              systemic disenfranchisement, such as how literacy was once
              restricted to elites. The metaphor of transportation (“if a bus
              doesn’t go there, you need a car”) mirrors Kasapis’s logic of
              infrastructure: access begets access, and without it, you’re
              stuck. Kasapis’s arguments are supported by a growing body of
              research. The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) reports that
              nearly half the world’s population still lacks reliable access,
              citing affordability, infrastructure, and digital literacy as key
              barriers. Moreover, UNESCO has advocated for “meaningful
              connectivity”, not just access—emphasizing that internet quality,
              speed, and usage opportunities also matter. Scholars like Laura
              Mann and Nick Couldry have also written extensively on how
              platform capitalism creates new global hierarchies, where access
              determines one’s place in digital economies. Their work reinforces
              Kasapis’s view that the internet is not just a marketplace of
              ideas, but also labour and survival. Spyros Kasapis’s blog post is
              a concise yet powerful intervention into debates about digital
              inequality. By framing internet access as a human right deeply
              tied to survival, especially during times of crisis, he challenges
              readers to consider the ethical and political structures behind
              digital access. Through a mix of personal conviction,
              authoritative references, and global critique, he encourages a
              shift in how we perceive connectivity, not as a privilege, but as
              a foundational requirement for participation in society.

              The article Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet

              access, and feminist activism on the African continent. Against
              the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, it critiques the illusion

              central aim of the article is to make visible how access to the
              internet is uneven and deeply politicized, especially for women,
              LGBTIQA+ individuals, and other marginalized groups. The
              methodology is grounded in both personal narrative and collective
              experience, drawing on the October 2019 Making a Feminist Internet
              in Africa and the Diaspora gathering. This approach is significant
              because it reframes internet governance not as a top-down,
              policy-driven domain, but as a lived and shared concern for those
              often excluded from decision-making. One of the most compelling
              insights from the article is the critique of techno-solutionism,
              the belief that digital tools can solve complex social problems.
              This critique echoes broader concerns raised by scholars such as
              Evgeny Morozov and resonates with Spyros Kasapis’ blog post on
              internet access as a human right, which similarly highlights how
              structural inequalities shape digital participation. Both texts
              underscore that without considering context, infrastructure, and
              social positioning, digital “solutions” can exacerbate the very
              problems they claim to address. A recurring theme in the article
              is the “danger of a single story,” a concept popularized by
              Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The author notes how African
              technological innovation is often framed through deficit
              narratives emphasizing survival rather than creativity, and
              necessity rather than joy. Feminist internet gatherings offer a
              counterpoint: spaces of joy, play, and shared knowledge that
              refuse reductive portrayals. These gatherings not only enable
              solidarity across borders but also challenge dominant digital
              aesthetics and content that marginalize Black, queer, fat,
              disabled, and non-normative bodies and identities. Importantly,
              the article situates the internet as both a tool of oppression and
              a site of resistance. It highlights how online gender-based
              violence is rampant, yet often unrecognized in African legal
              systems. This gap between online harm and offline redress
              illustrates the urgent need for feminist digital justice
              frameworks that can navigate the entanglement of online and
              offline realities. The author's call for a more inclusive,
              diverse, and joyful internet is not simply utopian, it’s
              strategic, rooted in lived experience, and attuned to both the
              risks and potential of the digital sphere. Ultimately, this
              article is not just a critique, but a call to action. It compels
              readers to imagine and work toward an internet where African
              feminists not only participate but lead. In a time of isolation
              and uncertainty, building such a digital space is not optional. It
              is, as the article states, “crucial.”

          <div class="e-content">
            <p>
              When thinking about how our code matters in the context of
              decolonialism, it’s important to remember that code is not
              neutral. The tools, languages, and frameworks we use — and the
              assumptions we embed in our designs — all come from specific
              worldviews. These worldviews often reflect dominant, Western
              norms. As a developer and designer, I’ve started to reflect on
              what this means for my own practice, particularly when creating
              web-based projects. One of the key things I’ve become more aware
              of is accessibility — not just in terms of screen readers or
              keyboard navigation, but in cultural accessibility too. Who is my
              code speaking to? Who is left out? Am I designing with assumptions
              about language, internet speed, device capability, or even ways of
              understanding space and interaction? In a decolonial approach, I
              have to question whose needs are centered in my work and whether I
              am reinforcing systems of exclusion through my design choices.
              This has influenced the way I approach interactivity, especially
              as I’ve started integrating JavaScript into my website. Initially,
              my site was a static HTML/CSS structure, which limited how users
              could interact with the content. Adding JavaScript forced me to
              rethink the layout and structure. I had to refactor parts of the
              site to allow for dynamic content updates, responsive feedback,
              and more intuitive navigation. For example, I implemented a
              JavaScript-based menu that adapts to screen size and user input.
              Instead of relying on visual cues only, I began considering how to
              provide sound or text feedback for users who might interact
              differently — whether due to disability, device limitations, or
              different cognitive preferences. This small change became a
              gateway to bigger questions about inclusive interaction design.
              Incorporating JavaScript also helped me streamline the user
              experience. I could now use event listeners and conditionals to
              guide users through tasks without overwhelming them with static
              content all at once. Forms became smarter. Feedback became
              immediate. But even here, I had to pause: was I relying too
              heavily on JavaScript in a way that made the site unusable for
              people on low-end devices or slow networks? Decolonial thinking
              reminded me that performance is not just a technical concern —
              it’s also a justice issue. Ultimately, my development process is
              becoming less about “adding features” and more about asking better
              questions. JavaScript isn’t just a tool — it’s a medium that can
              either reinforce or resist dominant design norms. As a developer
              committed to ethical, inclusive practice, I want to use it to
              empower, not exclude. This means staying critical of my own
              assumptions, seeking out alternative ways of thinking about
              interaction, and being intentional about whose voices and needs
              are considered in every line of code. That’s what decolonial
              coding looks like to me.

              What Does an Ethical Internet Look Like to Me? An ethical
              internet, to me, is one where the rights, dignity, and safety of
              all users are prioritized over profit, power, and surveillance. It
              is not just about having access to the internet—it’s about what
              kind of access, who controls it, and what values shape it. The
              article Making a Feminist Internet in Africa (APC, 2019) deeply
              influenced my understanding of how the internet can reproduce
              structural inequalities unless consciously designed otherwise. An
              ethical internet is feminist in the sense that it challenges
              existing power imbalances, especially those rooted in patriarchy,
              racism, and colonialism. For example, the internet should be a
              space where marginalised voices are amplified, not silenced by
              algorithmic bias or harassment. This requires not just better
              moderation, but platforms built from the ground up with care and
              consent in mind. Consent is a major pillar of ethical internet
              design. Too often, platforms like Facebook or TikTok gather user
              data in opaque ways, reducing our autonomy. According to Zuboff
              (2019) in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the internet has
              become a space of extraction—data is harvested without meaningful
              consent and monetised by corporations. An ethical alternative
              would involve transparent data practices, user ownership of data,
              and stricter regulations to prevent surveillance. Accessibility is
              also crucial. An ethical internet ensures people of all abilities
              and backgrounds can use it meaningfully. This means designing with
              inclusivity in mind: screen reader compatibility, affordable
              access, multilingual content, and culturally relevant design. The
              idea of "universal design" from digital ethics readings supports
              this, insisting that we consider the most vulnerable users first.
              Finally, the internet should support collective well-being. This
              doesn’t mean enforcing a single moral code, but rather enabling
              pluralism while protecting against hate and harm. Platform
              accountability is key—when companies profit from polarisation or
              misinformation, as seen with YouTube's recommendation algorithm
              (Tufekci, 2018), they must be held responsible. Ethical platforms
              would prioritise human rights over engagement metrics. In essence,
              an ethical internet is not just about better rules; it’s about
              reimagining digital space through care, equity, and justice. It
              must be actively shaped by the people who use it—not just
              engineers and CEOs, but communities, educators, artists, and
              activists too. That’s the internet I want to help build.

              Interactive Media Essay UI, UX, and Ethics in the Makro Website
            </h5>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
              User Interface (UI) refers to the point of interaction between
              humans and computers, encompassing visual and auditory elements
              such as typography, icons, buttons, animations, and sounds [1].
              The design of a UI is closely intertwined with the User Experience
              (UX), which is the emotional and functional response users have
              while engaging with a system. While a conceptual distinction
              between UI and UX can be made, they are often best evaluated
              together in practice. In the contemporary digital landscape,
              websites are intentionally constructed to guide user interaction,
              often in service of commercial objectives. Profit-driven design is
              not inherently unethical; however, the strategies used to secure
              profit can tread the line between persuasive and manipulative.
              Furthermore, because legislation frequently lags behind
              technological innovation, defining ethical boundaries in digital
              design remains a complex and evolving challenge. This essay
              critically analyses the UI and UX design of the South African
              supermarket chain Makro’s website. It evaluates the site’s
              adherence to key interface principles, the psychological
              strategies underlying its user experience, and the ethical
              implications of its design decisions.
            </p>
            <h5>User Interface (UI)</h5>
            <p>
              According to core UI principles covered in the course, an
              effective interface should be intuitive, simple, and consistent.
              [7] An "intuitive" interface allows users to navigate without
              prior training, often achieved by adhering to established design
              conventions. "Simple" refers to a clean and manageable information
              layout, while "consistent" design ensures users do not need to
              relearn functions across pages. Makro’s website, as an e-commerce
              and catalogue platform, follows widely accepted web conventions.
              The homepage presents a broad array of products to inform users of
              available offerings. Features such as search, filtering options,
              and a shopping cart provide clear pathways to interaction and
              conversion. The site excels in consistency: product listings are
              uniformly structured, with transparent banner images, long-form
              names, pricing, and customer ratings. Although some product names
              are lengthy, this choice prioritizes informational clarity over
              minimalism. Filtering tools, categorized by price, brand, and
              rating, are predictably structured across sections, reducing
              cognitive load and supporting smooth user navigation. In terms of
              simplicity, the site employs a restrained colour palette (black
              text on a white background, with yellow accents), readable fonts,
              and universally understandable icons. Importantly, icons are
              always paired with text descriptions, reinforcing the emphasis on
              accessibility and clarity. However, the homepage lacks a strong
              visual hierarchy, a key UI principle defined by visual weight,
              contrast, spacing, and font size [2]. With numerous banners and
              categories vying for attention, users may struggle to prioritize
              content. The absence of contrast diminishes guidance, resulting in
              a page where all elements appear equally important, thus weakening
              overall navigability. In summary, Makro’s UI is largely intuitive,
              consistent, and user-friendly, though it would benefit from
              improved visual hierarchy to better guide user attention,
              specifically with the Home Page.
            </p>
            <h5>User Experience (UX)</h5>
            <p>
              UX design draws heavily on psychological principles intended to
              guide user behaviour. Notable among these are Hick’s Law, the
              Zeigarnik Effect, Fitts’s Law, and the Serial Position Effect [8].
              According to other sources other relevant ideas include the active
              user Jakob’s Law. [3] Makro’s website demonstrates thoughtful
              application of these principles to enhance usability and encourage
              user engagement. Hick’s Law suggests that too many options can
              overwhelm users. While Makro’s homepage presents a wide selection
              of content, it does so in a well-structured layout that mitigates
              confusion. During the checkout process, unrelated options are
              removed, maintaining user focus and supporting conversion. The
              Zeigarnik Effect, which posits that incomplete tasks are more
              memorable than completed ones, is utilized through persistent
              “View All” and “Shop Now” prompts, encouraging continued
              engagement. The inclusion of a progress bar during checkout
              leverages this effect to nudge users toward finalizing purchases.
              Jakob’s Law highlights users’ preference for familiar interfaces.
              Makro adheres to established e-commerce conventions, allowing
              users to rely on prior knowledge. This aligns with the “active
              user” principle, which recognizes that most users learn by doing
              rather than reading manuals. In contrast, Fitts’s Law, which
              relates to the time required to move to a target area (i.e.,
              clickable buttons), is less effectively implemented. On desktop,
              the category icons lead to dropdowns rather than direct
              navigation, adding unnecessary steps that hinder usability. More
              broadly, the UX reflects an understanding of the intended user,
              the general consumer. The site avoids polarizing aesthetics or
              statements, instead opting for neutrality and accessibility. It is
              clearly designed for wide appeal, aligning with Makro’s
              positioning as a mass-market retailer.
            </p>
            <h5>UI & UX Intersection</h5>
            <p>
              Makro’s interface and experience coalesce to support clear and
              frictionless navigation. Despite the size and variety of its
              catalogue, the website manages to maintain a relatively clean and
              structured layout. By prioritizing accurate product information
              and minimizing the influence of individual brand aesthetics, Makro
              maintains its identity as a neutral distributor. For example,
              although products like iPhones are sold, items often associated
              with status, the platform itself avoids adopting such branding
              cues. This deliberate neutrality reinforces the platform’s
              accessibility and functionality over prestige. The consistency of
              design supports predictability, while the subtle integration of
              persuasive UX strategies enhances usability without undermining
              user autonomy. The result is a platform that balances
              functionality, simplicity, and neutrality in service of its
              commercial goals. In summary, the design principles of both UI and
              UX are met but not exceeded. For example, the simplicity is not
              minimalism. All the relevant standards are addressed when needed
              but nothing more or less than what is needed is done.
            </p>
            <h5>Ethics</h5>
            <p>
              Ethical digital design requires both the inclusion of diverse,
              respectful content and the avoidance of manipulative practices. As
              defined by UX Primer, ethical UX prioritizes user autonomy,
              privacy, and well-being [4]. Makro’s website maintains an
              inclusive tone by avoiding targeted messaging and focusing
              primarily on product information. While the occasional marketing
              banner features diverse individuals, the general aesthetic remains
              universal and product-centred. This reinforces a broad, accessible
              appeal that does not alienate or overly target any demographic.
              Importantly, the site refrains from dark patterns, design tactics
              that deceive or coerce users. There are no false claims of
              urgency, limited availability, or misleading calls to action.
              Notifications are opt-in rather than disruptive, and users retain
              full control over their experience. Even transitions to
              third-party payment windows are clearly indicated, with easy
              navigation back to the main site. Respect for the user’s autonomy
              is clear. As noted in UX Matters, the distinction between
              persuasion and manipulation lies in the preservation of
              transparency and agency [5]. As stated previously, clear and
              correct information is a key component of the site. Transparency
              is present. Makro’s design choices clearly fall on the ethical
              side of this line. The site encourages purchases without obscuring
              information, misleading users, or restricting freedom of choice.
              The user does not have to create an account to browse or share
              their location if they don’t want to. Notifications are opt-in.
              Everything about the site is geared to not manipulating the user
              but simply guiding them. The user is able to opt out of a decision
              at any time and is informed when a decision will be final. There
              is further information available on return policies, delivery
              dates and more. Ethical design basically means making conscious
              design decisions that do good and do not harm anyone, either
              intentionally or unintentionally. The design of the site is
              intentional, and the intention is neutrality as a brand
              representation. Transparency of the process with regards to the
              product, price and more. Intentionality of respecting the user’s
              agency and choice. The website respects human rights, effort and
              experience as laid out in the Ethical Design Manifesto [6].

            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
              Makro’s website offers a compelling example of ethical,
              user-centred design in the context of e-commerce. Its interface is
              intuitive, consistent, and largely simple, though improvements in
              visual hierarchy would enhance clarity. The site applies
              psychological principles to guide users effectively through its
              vast product offerings without resorting to coercive or deceptive
              techniques. Importantly, its ethical approach respects user
              autonomy and promotes transparency. In achieving its commercial
              objectives, Makro manages to create a user experience that is both
              functional and principled. Makro’s design succeeds not because it
              is flashy or innovative, but because it is quietly functional,
              inclusive, and respectful. In a commercial world where
              manipulation is often normalized, this restraint is its most
              ethical feature.

              Outer Wilds: How the Music Is Woven into the Essence of the Game
              The essence of Outer Wilds is exploration for the sake of
              curiosity and connection. This reflection analyses how the music
              (distinct from the broader sound design) deeply supports and
              enhances these themes. Everything Is Connected The idea that
              everything is connected in Outer Wilds is central to its
              macro-level design and encourages the player to explore. This is
              exemplified by the ship’s log (above), a gameplay feature designed
              to help players piece together the overarching mystery. The music
              supports this sense of connection by being embedded into the core
              of the game’s design, rather than existing as a passive background
              layer. Composer Andrew Prahlow stated in an interview with Jesse
              Vitelli of Prima Games.com that he explicitly aimed to avoid
              creating “wallpaper” (Stuart, 2020) music that loops without
              intention, as is common in many games. While numerous games
              feature memorable soundtracks—such as Hollow Knight or the Super
              Mario series—these tend to serve as complements to the world
              rather than components of it. Prahlow approached the Outer Wilds
              score as a film composer might: music is triggered only when it
              serves a narrative or emotional purpose. As a result, much of the
              game is spent in relative silence, with only the ambient sounds of
              the ship or the player’s spacesuit audible. This deliberate
              minimalism contributes to the game’s cinematic feel, even though
              it lacks traditional cutscenes, voice acting, or photorealistic
              visuals. While art direction plays a significant role, the music’s
              restraint and timing are equally critical to the game’s
              atmosphere. This film-score approach supports the idea that Outer
              Wilds is intended to be a singular, impactful experience—not
              necessarily a game to be replayed or mastered, but one to be felt.
              Homeliness and Vastness As a lone traveller trapped in a time
              loop, the player explores a small solar system and uncovers the
              story of a lost civilization known as the Nomai. The game
              masterfully balances feelings of comfort and vastness—two
              contrasting sensations—and the music is integral to achieving
              this. Tracks like “Timber Hearth” and “Campfire Song” evoke warmth
              and familiarity, while pieces associated with the Nomai introduce
              tones that feel alien, ancient, and haunting. Prahlow, in an
              interview with Game Developer.com described “Timber Hearth” as
              grounded in a core idea of “relaxation,” and explained that the
              Nomai music was designed to sound like “a piano being ripped apart
              in space.” (Prahlow,2019) The track “The Museum” blends motifs
              from both “Timber Hearth” and the Nomai themes—featuring synth
              drones, piano, and a banjo riff. It musically symbolizes the
              intersection of the Hearthians and the Nomai, reinforcing the
              game’s theme of cosmic connection. The game is often isolating.
              The music, or lack thereof, reinforces this solitude. When “End
              Times” begins to play, it marks a profound moment of reflection
              and acceptance as the universe resets once again. Music and
              Mechanics The game’s sense of isolation is not only countered by
              “End Times,” but also by the signalscope—perhaps the strongest
              argument for how the music is integrated into gameplay itself. At
              any moment, the player can pull out the signalscope and detect the
              musical signatures of fellow travellers playing their instruments.
              These diegetic songs remind the player that they are not truly
              alone. More than just a comfort, the signalscope is a mechanical
              tool for exploration, functioning as a musical compass that leads
              players to key locations. Whenever the player enters an area of
              Nomai ruins, a piano motif begins to play. According to Prahlow,
              this was designed to “help you notice that you’re in a place of
              importance.” This subtle musical cue encourages exploration,
              reinforcing the central mechanic of uncovering knowledge. If the
              player becomes stuck, they can rely on the presence of these
              fragments of music to guide them. The mechanical design of the
              ship and jetpack is intuitive and polished, and the music
              complements these systems to amplify the joy of movement and
              discovery. The Finale: A Symphony of Connection The final sequence
              of Outer Wilds is emotionally profound and musically climactic. As
              the player exits the time loop by removing the warp core, “End
              Times” reprises—but this time, it is transformed. Each traveller
              is revealed to have been playing the same song all along, and
              together, they gather around a final campfire as the universe
              collapses, and a new Big Bang begins. This moment is underscored
              by a reimagined version of the main theme: now synthesized,
              expansive, and emotionally weighted. The music mirrors the
              narrative’s resolution—a blend of grounded intimacy and cosmic
              scope. Beginning with acoustic, folk-inspired melodies and
              evolving into something more ambient and otherworldly, the score
              encapsulates the lifespan of both civilizations and the emotional
              journey of the player. References: • Game Developer. (2019, August

              Disco Elysium: The Existentialist RPG (Role Playing Game) A
              critical reflection on how Disco Elysium expands the RPG genre
              Disco Elysium stands apart as an RPG that dares to strip the genre
              to its philosophical roots. The game has truly simple
              mechanics—it's a point-and-click, largely text-based game, but
              beneath this minimalist surface lies a richly complex narrative
              structure. Rather than focusing on combat or loot, Disco Elysium
              leans heavily into narratology over ludology. In other words, it
              prioritizes story and character development over traditional
              gameplay systems. I will discuss how Disco Elysium fits
              comfortably within the confines of the RPG classification but
              challenges the stereotypes of the genre. According to Sam
              Liberty’s article RPG’s have the following defining features: -
              You play as a specific, predefined character. - Character
              advancement/customization. - The character has game statistics. -
              The player makes decisions for the character. All these
              requirements are met. The player plays as a washed-up detective
              with no memory of who he is. This may sound limiting compared to
              RPGs that let you create your own hero, but Disco Elysium turns
              that on its head. The game offers a unique kind of character
              customization: instead of upgrading weapons or armour, you are
              upgrading your own mind. Progression is deeply introspective. Your
              “skill tree” is really a thought cabinet, and your
              stats—Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics—are directly tied
              to your personality and how your character processes the world
              around him. This is where Disco Elysium takes its boldest step.
              Your build doesn’t just influence what you do in the game—it
              shapes what you perceive. A highly empathetic character will
              notice things others miss in conversations, while one with high
              Inland Empire might start hallucinating. One early scene has the
              player examine the body of a hanged man—a central murder victim.
              If your character’s Inland Empire (a surreal, intuitive stat) is
              high enough, the corpse starts talking back. It’s not just a
              hallucination—it’s a moment that fuses character psychology with
              world interaction, blending narrative depth with mechanical
              consequence. Dialogue options shift dramatically depending on your
              stats. One of Disco Elysium’s most striking mechanics is the
              internal thought system, where different parts of the
              protagonist’s psyche—like Authority, Empathy, or Inland
              Empire—interject during conversations, shaping dialogue choices
              and even how information is interpreted. This transforms typical
              RPG dialogue trees into a negotiation with yourself, tying
              mechanics directly into the game’s themes of identity and
              instability. This turns each playthrough into a fundamentally
              different experience, not because the world changes, but because
              your character’s lens on it does. This links to the philosophical
              nature of the game and the relativist idea that perception shapes
              reality. The player can continually choose to change their
              perception by doing drugs, putting skill points into other In this
              sense, the game feels infinite—not in terms of world size or quest
              quantity, but in how deeply it allows for roleplay and internal
              variance. The dragons you’re slaying aren’t monsters—they’re your
              own insecurities, delusions, and traumas. Disco Elysium also draws
              inspiration from traditional tabletop RPGs (TTRPGs) rather than
              modern computer RPGs (CRPGs or ARPGs). The character sheet is
              clear and familiar, the game uses literal dice rolls for checks,
              and the art—expressionist, painterly—is evocative of analogue
              play. The game as a relatively small map, compared to other CRPGs
              like open world of Skyrim, and apots a topdown view, almost like
              looking at the board of a board game. This analogue aesthetic,
              paired with heavy textual storytelling, builds a tactile sense of
              immersion. It's familiar yet strange, like reading a novel with
              stats. In Roger Caillois’ terms, Disco Elysium is squarely in the
              category of mimicry—the game is about adopting a role and fully
              inhabiting it. But this mimicry is deeply reflexive: by playing a
              character grappling with identity and meaning, you end up
              examining your own. The game’s absurdist realism and critical
              stance on politics, ethics, and society push you to engage not
              just with the fiction, but with real-world systems of power and
              marginalization. Ultimately, Disco Elysium is a philosophical
              RPG—a rare game that blends simple mechanics with existential
              weight. It doesn’t just let you play a character; it forces you to
              become one, flaws and all. And in doing so, it redefines what an
              RPG can be. It shares some of the weaknesses common to
              narrative-heavy RPGs—especially in the midgame, where the sheer
              amount of lore, politics, and side content can feel overwhelming
              or even aimless. When you're just trying to find your gun, being
              pulled into dense ideological debates can feel frustrating. But
              this is also the point: Disco Elysium is not a power fantasy—it’s
              a vulnerability fantasy. By slowing down the pace and demanding
              intellectual engagement, it asks players to reflect rather than
              react. In doing so, it expands the RPG genre into something
              stranger, more honest, and deeply human. Reference List - Liberty,

              Super Mario Galaxy: Teach It to Me Like I’m an 8-Year-Old An
              analysis of how Super Mario Galaxy teaches players through
              intuitive design Super Mario Galaxy is a masterclass in
              tutorialization, especially as it relates to the introduction of
              new mechanics. It teaches the players to play a game not through
              walls of text, but through level design and visual feedback. From
              the opening moments to later levels, the game introduces complex
              mechanics in ways that feel natural, playful, and effortless. This
              blog breaks down how it does that, starting with the tutorial and
              further analysis on Freezeflame Galaxy. The Tutorial Level:
              Learning Through Play The game begins with a low-stakes challenge:
              catch three bunnies hopping around a small planet. It seems like a
              simple and fun opening, but this sequence is secretly doing a lot
              of heavy lifting. The player is learning movement, camera control,
              and the unusual sensation of navigating spherical terrain, without
              being overtly told how to do it. It’s what Brian Sutton-Smith
              might call frivolous play—fun for its own sake, but deeply
              instructive underneath. The fact that the planet is spherical is a
              quiet technical and design breakthrough. It subtly encourages
              players to experiment with movement in a 3D space that doesn't
              obey the usual platforming rules. Giving players a small planet to
              move around is an intentional design choice and a smart way to let
              them feel out this strange new gravitational system without risk.
              Shake It Up: Introducing the Launch Star Soon after, players
              encounter a Launch Star, requiring them to shake the Wii Remote to
              activate it. This introduces one of the game’s key mechanics:
              motion control. Though the Wii wasn't the first console to use
              motion input, Galaxy helped popularize the idea, and did so by
              embedding it in the fabric of gameplay rather than making it a
              gimmick. The shaking of the remote is made to be just another
              mechanic, like pressing a button, in this easy going tutorial
              style. In general, the game uses minimal text, and when it does,
              it highlights key words or pairs them with intuitive icons. While
              some text is still necessary, Galaxy trusts its level design and
              visuals to do most of the talking. Sometimes informative
              animations will pop up in conjunction with the text and icons, to
              ensure the player knows what to do. To avoid overwhelming the
              player, each planet in the tutorial area is small and
              self-contained. There’s little risk of getting lost, and every
              mechanic introduced is directly tied to something visually or
              physically satisfying, like launching into space or smashing
              crystals. Visual Feedback and Camera Framing One of the most
              impressive tools Galaxy uses is the camera. When the player
              interacts with a key object like the vibrating obelisks that stun
              enemies by sending vibrations through the whole planet, the camera
              zooms out to show the result, then quickly refocuses on Mario.
              This gives the player both the what happened and the what to do
              next. It’s a subtle but powerful form of visual communication. In
              addition to the camera the obelisks look similar to the breakable
              crystals, tis prompts the player to shake the obelisk without
              being told to leading to the player discovering what it does. Like
              most games. Galaxy continually introduces new mechanics and level
              gimmicks and therefore tutorialization does not stop at the
              tutorial level. Case Study: Freezeflame Galaxy Later in the game,
              Freezeflame Galaxy offers a brilliant example of scaffolded
              learning. It introduces the Ice Flower and Fire Flower—temporary
              power-ups that change how Mario interacts with the environment. •
              The first star tutorializes ice and the Ice Flower. You land on an
              icy disk with breakable crystals that beg to be shaken. Doing so
              teaches the player they can skate on ice when they shake the
              remote. The level design forces the player to learn. Shortly
              after, they discover the Ice Flower and they learn they can freeze
              water to create new platforms. The level design and placement of
              obstacles makes learning this incredibly intuitive for the player.
              They land on a sprinkler when they collect the Ice flower,
              instantly freezing it. • The second star introduces the Fire
              Flower, letting Mario light torches to open gates and create
              stairways. This level is slightly harder and less intuitive than
              the first, as is the natural difficulty progression. • The third
              star combines both mechanics, testing everything the player has
              learned. This slow layering of complexity, combined with clever
              planet and level design, ensures the player is never confused, but
              always learning. Genre Galaxy is a classic 3D platformer but with
              the advancements in technology making spherical planets possible
              and shaking the Wii remote a core mechanic, it is obvious that it
              changed the genre and expanded it. Because of these changes to a
              very popular genre of gaming and franchise of games the
              tutorialisation was integral to the game’s success. Players should
              feel like these things were expansions to a beloved genre. A way
              to a complexity not complication. The setting of galaxies set the
              tone for this and due to the tight mechanics and intuitive
              introduction of them the game succeeded in this. Guidance Without
              Handholding Even small touches, like the preview clips before each
              level, help orient the player. You’re never left feeling lost.
              Super Mario Galaxy guides without over-explaining. It respects the
              player’s ability to figure things out through playful
              experimentation.
