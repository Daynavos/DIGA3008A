      <h4>GitHub and Goals for the Course <a href="#top">^</a></h4>
      <p>
        Setting up GitHub was a straightforward process. I found it fascinating to discover how simple it is to publish a web page. This demystified the process of creating websites, for which I am grateful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I read “As We May Think at 65,” along with articles about the dot-com bubble and Web 2.0. These three readings complement each other well. One key takeaway for me was the personal aspect explored in both “Think 65” and “Web 2.0.” Bush envisioned access to information mimicking the human brain, aiming for a dynamic thought process rather than the hierarchical structure of alphabetized lists. 
        I believe Hypermedia is the closest we've come to replicating the human process of jumping from one thought to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        The personal aspect, however, is what intrigues me the most. Web 2.0 focuses on making the web an interactive and personal experience. While this has many benefits, a concerning truth is that much of this personalization is profit-driven. Personalized ads are a prime example, though the implications go far beyond this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Main Concerns:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Ecosystems of Conformity:</strong> Within the web, ecosystems are being created where people are shown only what they want to see and are reinforced in their beliefs. This could allow harmful views to thrive unchecked.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Capitalist Overtones:</strong> The dot-com bubble illustrates how much of the web is driven by publicly traded companies. Their profits depend on continuous growth, which drives tactics aimed at capturing attention and increasing time spent online. Such practices can foster addiction and unsafe habits.
          </li>
        </ol>
        As a result, the web has become an overwhelming space. While Bush's vision of dynamic information retrieval has been achieved, it is often overshadowed by the noise created by profit-driven motives. This constant growth desired by tech companies seems unsustainable, and the dot-com bubble at the turn of the century signals the risks of unchecked expansion.

        Reflection on Moulthrop's Hypertext and the Laws of Media
        <a href="#top">^</a>
      </h4>
      <p>
        The reading largely deals with hypertext and its relationship to Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media. The article further explores the political, social, and cultural implications of this new form of media. 
        With each of McLuhan’s four laws, Moulthrop makes it clear that the "revolution" is blocked by corporate-owned platforms and not truly fueled by intellectual engagement. This, however, seems to be the case with all media the world has ever encountered. 
        Where there is media, there will be propaganda. Where there is information, it will be manipulated and withheld. Hypertext is not immune to this, and the influence seems to be greater since more and more information can be consumed faster, leading to misinformation and propaganda all around.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What does hypertext enhance?</strong> The first law of McLuhan’s Media is that a new form of media should enhance some sort of human faculty. The big enhancement of hypertext is its ability to closely simulate a human thought process. 
        Nonlinear information retrieval and intertextuality skyrocketed. This is constantly improving and can be seen in activities like the Wikirace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What does hypertext render obsolete?</strong> Moulthrop states that hypertext has not rendered other media obsolete but has caused a significant shift in how people choose to engage with information. Many books have been converted to a hypertext format, where it is easy to jump from one chapter or topic to another. 
        Hypertext has enhanced physical media and is slowly replacing it, with environmental concerns and convenience being big driving factors in today’s time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What does hypertext retrieve?</strong> Moulthrop states that hypertext is more interactive than books but less so than TV. He claims that hypertext has almost "fetched" old literacy and brought it into the interactive era.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What happens when hypertext reaches its limit?</strong> McLuhan argued that when a medium is pushed to its extreme, it reverses into its opposite. Moulthrop applies this idea to hypertext, suggesting that rather than fostering an open, participatory network, it has increasingly been controlled by corporate and institutional interests.

      <h5>What does interaction mean to you?</h5>
      <p>
        Interaction, for the purposes of this course, has been defined as the ability to meaningfully change the state of something. This definition suits me well. I do, however, feel that this definition is geared towards excluding books and film. 
        I see the value of this exclusion since the nature of these media is very linear and static. However, I believe that these forms of media can be included with an asterisk since the way in which you choose to interact with the media can change its influence on you, even if it does not truly change the media itself. 
        Nonetheless, I think it is prudent to exclude these "static media" from our definition.

      <h4>User Alignment and Mapping Out My Site <a href="#top">^</a></h4>
      <p>
        <strong>User Alignment:</strong> The primary goal of my portfolio website is to attract employment opportunities in technical fields such as Software Development, Game Design, or Web Development. 
        My target audience consists of potential employers seeking candidates with strong technical skills and creative problem-solving abilities. To effectively engage these users, my portfolio must clearly communicate my expertise while providing a seamless and engaging browsing experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Site Content Mapping:</strong> To organize my portfolio effectively, I have structured the content into different skill-based categories:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Software:</strong> Birds—a project showcasing my software development skills.</li>
          <li><strong>Game Design:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>Games—a collection of games I have worked on.</li>
              <li>Itch—a link to my Itch.io profile for game projects.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Personal Projects:</strong> Music—showcasing my personal creative projects outside of software and game development.</li>
        </ul>
        Each section will highlight my skills and accomplishments in the respective domain, making it easy for employers to quickly assess my capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>User Experience Focus:</strong> Employers often browse multiple portfolios when searching for candidates. To ensure my portfolio stands out, I aim to create an experience that is both visually appealing and functionally efficient. Key considerations include:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Easy Navigation:</strong> Employers should be able to locate relevant sections without unnecessary clicks.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> A fast-loading website ensures a smooth and frustration-free experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Intuitive Design:</strong> The site should not only look good but also feel good to use, providing an enjoyable interaction for the user.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interface Elements:</strong> The interface design focuses on two primary aspects:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> Inspired by the DIY, collage-style aesthetic of zines, my portfolio will feature a creative and visually unique layout.</li>
          <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Seamless navigation will enable users to explore content quickly while ensuring my skills and projects are clearly showcased.</li>
        </ul>
        The goal is to strike a balance between creativity and usability, making the site memorable while remaining professional and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Development Progress Reflection:</strong> This week, my focus has been on familiarizing myself with HTML and starting to build the foundational structure of the site. While the current version is still rough, progress is being made towards refining the layout and content organization.
        One area needing more attention is the implementation of semantic HTML strategies. This will be my focus in the coming week as I work toward making the site more structured and accessible. By improving semantic markup, I aim to enhance both readability for search engines and usability for visitors.

      <h4>IxD Process <a href="#top">^</a></h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Design Inspiration:</strong> I am drawing inspiration from classic zines, aiming to convey the aesthetic of print and physical media in my website. My focus is on incorporating this style while maintaining a functional and accessible design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Interaction Design Thoughts:</strong> My interaction design so far has prioritized navigation. I have added features like jump links and plan to integrate similar elements, such as status bars, to enhance usability. 
        I anticipate that the interaction experience of the website will evolve, becoming more complex. My main concern is ensuring that I do not lose sight of my website's core purpose as I introduce additional elements. 
        Ultimately, I want the site to communicate my skills in an accessible way that does not overwhelm or frustrate users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Wireframes Reflection:</strong> I feel my original wireframes have not been fully realized yet, which is why I believe they still hold up well. However, I expect they will be challenged as more stylistic and structural elements are added to the website. 
        I see my wireframes as placeholders, serving to guide development and prevent me from working aimlessly. I hold no illusion that they represent the final iteration of my website. Instead, I fully expect them to evolve as the design progresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Website 1 Development Reflection:</strong> The creation of Website 1 has been an interesting journey. While I have not found the implementation of languages particularly challenging, breaking down the design process into distinct layers rather than building component by component has been an adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I often struggle with resisting the urge to add depth and complexity to the site prematurely, rather than broadening and refining it gradually. This has made it difficult to see my wireframes materialize both structurally and artistically. 
        The disconnect between design and implementation, especially regarding structure, is a challenge I face—and one I believe others encounter as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Semantic Markup and Microformatting:</strong> I find semantic HTML both fascinating and overwhelming. I frequently worry whether I am adding too much or too little, which can be exhausting. 
        This struggle extends to microformatting, where similar concerns were even mentioned in the lecture videos. Despite this, I am proud of adhering to good semantic practices and avoiding hardcoding when organizing the structure or formatting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong> 
        <ul>
          <li>I am proud of the overall flow of my website, believing the navigation is simple, intuitive, and aligned with the website's purpose.</li>
          <li>This focus on clear and accessible navigation is one of my core interaction principles, which I feel I have executed well.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> My focus moving forward will be refining the layout, enhancing semantic markup, and continuing to align the design with the core principles of usability and accessibility.
